I am going to be doing a presentation on developing for iOS devices at the [Jacksonville Code Camp](http://www.jaxdug.net/codecamp/home "Jax Code Camp") on October 6th. The schedule has not been posted yet on the web site, but I just got notification that my presentation was selected. 

This presentation will be similiar to one I did in 2009\. Objective-C is the primary language used for developing apps on the iOS and the Mac. There have been a lot of changes to the iOS SDK since I did that last presentation in 2009.

The point of the presentation will be to familiarize Objective-C to C# and Java developers. There are a lot of similarities between C# and Objective-C. I will explore these so that C# or Java developer can walk away with better understanding using their existing knowledge.

I hope we get a good turn out for the JaxCodeCamp this year. Please tell your developer friends to come out a week from Saturday.
