I was just thinking back to my earliest experiences with Apple computers. When I was child, my elementary school has a lab of Apple II's. I started programming with the Apple Basic that WOZ had added to the ROMs on the Apple II. From that point on I was hooked to personal computing. Since 1986 I have owned six different Apple computers, five of them were Macintosh's including the G5 I use as my home computer now.

In the 90s when I was working in the print publishing industry, I really started to cut my teeth scripting with AppleScript.

In the 30 year history of Apple Computer, I have watched the company go from a media loved company, to a media hated company, back to a media loved company.

My attitude towards the company has not changed. I am a loyal customer, I love their products, yet they still piss me off from time to time. I look forward to seeing the products they produce over the next 30 years.

Congratulations to Apple for making it this far.
