I will be giving a presentation at the Jacksonville Developers User Group on the Orchard CMS tomorrow at 6:00 PM. I am going to use part of this presentation to demonstrate [Microsoft WebMatrix](http://www.asp.net/webmatrix). WebMatrix is a simple webserver and deployment tool. You can very quickly prototype a web site using one of many blogs or content management systems, and then deploy that site to a hosting provider.

Most of the presentation will cover the [Orchard CMS project](http://www.orchardproject.net). Orchard is a open source community focused content management system based on the ASP.NET MVC framework. Microsoft is sponsoring the project, and they are looking for collaborators. Orchard is currently at a 0.8 release. The Orchard team just implemented the new Razor engine as the default view engine.
