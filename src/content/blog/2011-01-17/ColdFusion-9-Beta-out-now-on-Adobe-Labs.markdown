Adobe has released public beta's now of ColdFusion 9 and Bolt (ColdFusion Builder) on [Adobe Labs](http://labs.adobe.com). A lot of attention has been payed to the new IDE, probably overshadowing the new server features.

Adobe has been receiving feedback from a language group about new language features that the community would like to have added to CF9\. Some of these new features include CFFinally, CFContinue and CFIMAP.

CFScript now has full language features. You can write CFCs completely in CFScript. I am really excited about this release of ColdFusion.
