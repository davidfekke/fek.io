I was reading Jen deHaan's [blog](http://weblogs.macromedia.com/dehaan/archives/2006/10/day_two_general.cfm) about the second day keynote. I was happy to read about Adobe CEO Bruce Chizen's comments.

<div class="code">Adobe wants to leverage the Macromedia relationship with developers, and enhance the great work that has already gone on. And not mess it up.</div>
I found this encouraging to hear. It is clear to me now that it wasn't just the Flash that Adobe wanted, they wanted Macromedia's developer community. 

Apollo is a technology that shows a broad vision. I feel that Adobe will be able to do what Apple, Sun and Microsoft have not been able to do, which is build a desktop environment that will be trully cross platform.
