John Lyons, a friend and co-worker of mine has figured out how to install CFMX 7 on the fedora core. He will be posting to this blog soon with instructions on how to configure CFMX and Apache 2.0.

It is tricky, but you can get it to work by manually configuring the connector to Apache. Macromedia does support CFMX with Red Hat, but not the Fedora core. Fedora is meant to be more expiramental than the standard Red Hat distro.
