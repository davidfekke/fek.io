I this link on Ben Forta's blog about a new project called [Ajax Data Services](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Ajax_Data_Services ) on Adobe Labs.

This Library lets you embed an invisible SWF file in your web page, and then use Flex Data Services to push data to your HTML content. It is extremely difficult to push to AJAX clients without a technology like this for developers.
