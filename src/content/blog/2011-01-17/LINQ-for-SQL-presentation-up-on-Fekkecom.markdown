The [presentation](http://www.fekke.com/SQLSaturdayLiNQ.ppt) I gave today on LINQ for SQL at SQL Saturday is up on my parent web site, [Fekke.com](http://www.fekke.com/).

This is a powerpoint file, but I originally did it as a keynote presentation. Most of the cool animation does not look as cool as it did in Keynote, but the information is all there.
