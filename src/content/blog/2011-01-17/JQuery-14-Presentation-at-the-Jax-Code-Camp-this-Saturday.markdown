I will be giving a presentation on [jQuery 1.4](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com/Agenda.aspx/Sessions "JQuery 1.4") this Saturday at the [Jax Code Camp](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com "Jax Code Camp"). This is the sixth annual code camp here in Jacksonville. This years camp will be held at the UNF campus. There are seven tracks this year. I hope to see my blog readers there.
