Sean Corfield has made some good observations on his [blog](http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm/do/blog.entry/entry/Duck_Typing_is_not_about_Performance) about duct typing. You should not duct type solely for performance.

One of the things that makes ColdFusion a rapid language for development is you are not required to specify a type for your parameters or return types.
