Not sure how I missed this one, but there is a new ColdFusion web site for answering ColdFusion questions called [cfanswers.org](http://www.cfanswers.org/). Thanks to Matt Woodward and Pete Farrell at the ColdFusion Weekly podcast for letting me know about this site. This works like Google Answers, where you can ask a question, and someone will answer the question. Unlike Google Answers, it is free and has not been shut down.
