A co-worker of mine, [John Lyons](http://john.lyons-den.org/), showed me a really cool tool for editing and auto-formatting XML. The tool is called [Butterfly XML](http://www.butterflyxml.org). It is built in Java and uses the tiny XML api to load your XML into DOM. It shows the DOM tree in a real time as you edit the XML, and will tell you if the document is well formed.

Oh, and did I metion it is Free!
