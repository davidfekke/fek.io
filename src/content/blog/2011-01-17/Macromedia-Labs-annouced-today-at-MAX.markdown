Macromedia officially announced Macromedia Labs today. From what I can tell, this will be a web site much like Google Labs where developers can try out the latest stuff from Macromedia.

Macromedia is allowing developers to download ALPHA trials of the Flash 8.5 player and Flex Builder 2\. FB2 is based on Zorn, and eclipse based IDE.
