This did not get a lot of attention yesterday, but Apple changed their name from Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple, Inc. Having worked at a Company that has changed their name, this can be a pretty big deal. For Apple it is not a total re-branding, but it reflects what they are doing now, consumer electronics.

That being said, when Apple introduced the iPod, they may not of counted on most of their money coming from iPod sales within five years.

The Apple iPhone and Apple TV are both products geared for consumer market. Microsoft is also headed in this direction as well with the XBox 360 and the Zune.
