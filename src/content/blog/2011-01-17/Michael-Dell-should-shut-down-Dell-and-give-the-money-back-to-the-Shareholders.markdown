It was ten years ago when Michael Dell answered a question about what Apple should do at an expo in Orlando with this comment;

    "What would I do? I'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders,"

This [Fortune CNN Money article](http://apple20.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2007/10/07/dell-vs-apple-10-years-later/) shows the difference in stock valuations between Apple and Dell. Apple is now worth more than twice then what Dell is worth as a company. To be fair, I think Michael regreted making that comment, but in the end it doesn not matter. Apple was able to inovate their way out of a crisis with good solid design.

Dell on the other hand does not inovate, they rely on Microsoft and Linux to do the inovating. Dell is not a technology company, they are a logitics company. Apple has applied a lot of those principles to their business, but they did not forget about design in the process.

I recently purchased a new laptop. I bought a MacBook Pro. I use it to run Vista and Mac OS X. I doubt I will ever buy a Dell.
