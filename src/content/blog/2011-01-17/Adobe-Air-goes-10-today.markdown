Adobe released [Air](http://get.adobe.com/air/) today, the Rich Internet Application runtime that lets run web application technology on the desktop.

I have written some flex apps that I am planning to release as Air apps. Adobe has lowered the price for Flex Builder to $249\. You can upgrade for as low $99 if you have a license for Flex Builder 2\.
