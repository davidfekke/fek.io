I was in San Jose last week for the managers summit. While I was out there I noticed that a lot of the developers use Macs.

I have been a Mac user since 1990, and I have a G5 for my home machine. I am trying to convince my company that I should get a MacBook Pro to replace my Dell laptop. [Sean Corfield](http://www.corfield.org/blog/) brought up some good points to me about how to convince your boss to get you a Mac for development.

The new MacBook Pro is an Intel based machine. Because it uses an x86 based processor, you can run multiple operating systems on it now. If you use [parallels](http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/), you can even run multiple OSes at the same time, and test your web apps in each browser.

If you host your applications on Unix servers, you can run your apps on the same OS that the server is running since Mac OS X is Unix based.

I do not know if I will be able to convince my boss to get me a Mac, but if he does not, I will probably get one to replace my home machine. I just bought my G5 about a year and a half ago, so it will probably be awhile before I replace that machine.
