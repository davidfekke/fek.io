I was just checking out the new Studio 8 on macromedia's web site. I checked out a video presentation on Dreamweaver 8\. The coolest features I saw had to do with css and different views including the screen reader. There is even a section 508 checker for accesibility concerns.

I have not looked at Flash 8 features yet, but it looks like there are some nice features related to mobile apps.
