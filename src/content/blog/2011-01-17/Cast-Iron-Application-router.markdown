Next week I start training on the Cast Iron Application Router. This is a hardware device designed for streamlining enterprise application integrations. It can connect to applications through a range of methods including smtp, http, ftp, SOAP and MQ Series.

It uses a graphically based studio to design integrations between amplications. It is very similiar to DTS Packages and SSIS if you are familiar with SQL Server. As I learn more about this product, I will blog my experiences.
