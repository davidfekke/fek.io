The JaxFusion user group meeting is today at 6:30 PM. The meeting will be on the new release of ColdFusion 8\. I have a lot of giveaways for this meeting.

The meetings are held downtown in the Modis building on the second floor in conference room B. The address is on the [website](http://www.jaxfusion.org).
