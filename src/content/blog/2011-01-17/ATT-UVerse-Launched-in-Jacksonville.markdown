I read in [DSL Reports](http://www.dslreports.com/) that AT&T is launching [U-Verse in Jacksonville](http://www.consumerelectronicsnet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=496987).

The AT&T U-Verse <a href="" target="_blank">website</a> has a form that will allow you to check and see if their service is available in your neighborhood. As usual, this broadband service is not in my neighborhood.

U-Verse is AT&T's Fiber to the Curb or Fiber to the Premises service.
