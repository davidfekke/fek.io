There is a giant Spider bot net based SQL Injection attack going on right now. This has personally affected some friends of mine, and I have been reading about it on the CF-Talk list.

Unfortunately, there does not seem much that can be done about it other than to try to ride the storm out. I have not seen anything in the Tech press about this yet, but they seem to be a day late and dollar short anyways.
