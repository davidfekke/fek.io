I guess Vince from New Atlanta made a statement on the cf-talk list that Sean Corfield was a liar.

Vince says: 

Sean's statement that MySpace is "not (running) BlueDragon" is blatantly, factually false. 

Ok, here is my two cents. I think Vince overstated his claim that BlueDragon.NET was powering MySpace.com. I have met Sean before, and he is an honest guy. Marketing is just that, Marketing. Vince should chill.
