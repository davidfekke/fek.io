I was reading Scott Guthrie's [blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx) yesterday, where he said that Microsoft was releasing the the source code for the core .NET libraries for .NET 3.5 in 2008\. So does this mean that .NET will be Open Source? The answer to that question is no.

Microsoft is releasing the libraries under a [reference library](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/sharedsource/licensingbasics/referencelicense.mspx) so that the code can be used for debugging in the VS 2008 debugger. Read the post for more information.
