I updated the Podcast pod on my blog today. I removed the ColdFusion podcast from that pod, and added one for the Flex show. I am sorry to hear that the ColdFusion podcast is going on hiatus. Those guys plugged my blog a few times.

Jeffry Houser and Ryan Stewart are hosting the Flex show. It is good to hear the community building behind Flex.
