I am preparing a presentation on both Fusebox and Model-Glue. The most current version of Model-Glue is called Unity. In this version Joe Rinehart has added ColdSpring and Reactor into the Model-Glue framework.

One of the neat features of fusebox is the notion of lexicons. Lexicons let you add your own tags or verbs to the framework.

I was reading on MXNA that [Dope Fly](http://www.dopefly.com/techblog/entry.cfm?entry=148) has some downloads that will let you add ColdSpring and Reactor Lexicons to Fusebox. Pretty Cool.
