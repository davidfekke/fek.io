The [Jacksonville Code Camp](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com) needs [sponsors](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com/Sponsors.aspx). The Code Camp is a free event for developers now in its forth year.

Sponsorships can be as low as $25.00\. The code camp needs to raise $10,000 for the entire event. 

This years camp should be very good, because there will be tracks for .NET, Java, Ruby, Flex and ColdFusion.
