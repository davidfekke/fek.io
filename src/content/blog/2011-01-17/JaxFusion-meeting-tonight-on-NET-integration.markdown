Tonight we are having the first JaxFusion meeting at the new location at the Modis building in downtown Jacksonville. The meeting will be on the second floor in conference room A.

Tonights meeting will be on how to use ColdFusion with .NET and other Microsoft technologies including Exchange server. Some of these features are new to ColdFusion 8, but others can be used in the current versions of ColdFusion. I have a lot of swag to giveaway at tonights meeting as well.
