I was reading on [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/15/hd-dvd-deathwatch-were-making-it-official/) that they believe HD DVD is on a Death Watch. It seems to me that HD DVD has been on a Death Watch since Warner Bros dropped all support at the beginning of the year.

In the post at Engadget, Ryan Block also mentions that Blockbuster and Netflix have dropped HD DVD as well. There have also been stories that Toshiba, the creator of HD DVD, is looking at developing a Blu-Ray player.
