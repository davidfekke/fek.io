Pablo Varando from [EasyCFM.com](http://www.easycfm.com) has announced that he is launching a free ColdFusion 8 hosting service at the beginning of next year. The hosting service will be based on ColdFusion 8 and have either a MS Access or MS SQL Server 2005 database.

Pablo made this announcement on his [blog](http://co.ldfusion.com/index.cfm/2008/12/1/Free-ColdFusion-Hosting). He says he will have more details about this service soon, so check back soon.

Pablo has done this before successfully, so I look forward to this new service.
