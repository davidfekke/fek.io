The Oscars are this weekend, and I thought I would make my Oscar picks for this year and give my explanation as to why the academy will pick a nominee. Best Motion Picture of the Year:

Brokeback Mountain will when best picture. The academy will not be able to resist giving an Oscar to a movie about gay cowboys. I have not seen this one yet, but I doubt I will since that South Park episode about the independant film festival. In that episode, all independant films were about gay cowboys.

Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role:

Philip Seymour Hoffman will win for Capote. Hoffman is an Oscar fav, but I hope it goes to Terrence Howard for Hustle in Flow. His performances in Crash and Hustle and Flow and Crash were incredible.

Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role:

Dame Judi Dench will win for Mrs. Henderson Presents. She is always an Oscar fav.

Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role:

Matt Dillon will win for Crash. The Academy always loves a bad cop. Plus it is Matt Dillon, and he has been around for long time.

Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role:

Frances McDormand will win for North Country. McDormand is always a Oscar fav, plus she is married toa Coen brother, and that does not hurt.

Best Achievement in Directing:

Ang Lee will win for Brokeback Mountain. And Lee will be redeimed for making The Incedible Hulk, even though I liked that movie.

Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen:

Crash by Paul Haggis will win this one. Crash has themes that the Academy and I for that matter love. Paul is a great writter and I hope he wins this one.

Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published:

Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana will win for Brokeback Mountain. Larry McMurtry has penned many of the great screenplay for the last 40 years. The Academy loves him. I am personally partial to Lonesome Dove and Hud.

Best Achievement in Cinematography:

Rodrigo Prieto will win for Brokeback Mountain. This movie was shot in Canada, and it is impossible to make Canada look bad on film.

Best Achievement in Editing:

Michael Kahn will win for Munich. Plus he is the only nominee that still edits movies by splicing film together on a moviola. All the rest use computers now.

I will the the rest of my picks this afternoon.
