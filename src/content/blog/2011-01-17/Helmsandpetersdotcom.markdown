A while back I asked if there was anybody doing a ColdFusion podcast. Hal Helms and Jeff Peters have a [podcast](http://www.helmsandpeters.com) covering FLiP, the Fusebox Lifecycle Process. I have seen Hal and Jeff speak at several different user group meetings and software conferences. They are both great speakers.

You can find there podcast at [www.helmsandpeters.com](http://www.helmsandpeters.com).
