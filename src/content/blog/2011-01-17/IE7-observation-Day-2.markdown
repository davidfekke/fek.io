I think the Anti-phishing support that has been added to IE is a good thing. There is a noticeable lag in pages loading over slower connections. This is a feature I will turn on my Mom's computer. I did a test pulling up a web site that was in one of the numerous phishing emails I get everyday, and it prompted me with a phishing warning.
