I was saddened when I heard that the CFWeekly podcast was being retired. I thought Matt and Pete did an excellent job with that podcast. One of my favorite podcasts was when they had a round table of different CF developers. One of those developers was Brian Meloche.

Brian is now hosting a new podcast called [CF Conversations](http://www.cfconversations.com/). The first podcast has a round table with Rick Mason, Adam Haskell, Jeff Coughlin and Aaron West. I listened it this morning, and I really like the format. Keep up the good work Brian.
