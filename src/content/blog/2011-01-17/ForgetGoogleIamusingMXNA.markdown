My blog was recently added to the MXNA list of feeds. The great thing so far is the feedback that I am getting from other developers.

While trying to research a problem lately, I used Google and some other search engines to try to find the solution. After having no luck, I tried searching MXNA, and found the solutions I was looking for right on MXNA.

One of the flaws in Search Engines is that they index everything. If you are using common words, you will get more search results that a human can possibly dig through. The nice thing about MXNA, I can just search the feeds that would normallly have the answer I was looking for.
