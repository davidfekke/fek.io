Saw this [article](http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2007/06/core_anim) on Digg today. This Wired article talks about how Apple is adding a new Animation API to Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5). The important part of this article is that animation is starting to become a more important of the user experience. You can start to see this in the way Ajax and Flash are being used in web sites now. With Ajax and Flash coming to the desktop with Apollo, I think Apple and Microsoft are trying to differentiate themselves.

Of course Leopard has been delayed until this Fall. Microsoft just released an alpha of Silverlight, but I think we will start seeing more applications with these types of user interfaces.
