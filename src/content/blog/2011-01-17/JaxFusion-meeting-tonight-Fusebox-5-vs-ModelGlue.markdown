I will be doing a presentation tonight for the JaxFusion User Group tonight at Vurv Technology. The meeting starts at 6:30 PM ET.

The presentation will have a comparison of the Fusebox 5 framework and the Model-Glue framework. This presentation will also have a discussion on how these Frameworks compare to some of the other popular web application frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Struts, and Django.
