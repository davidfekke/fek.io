Adobe started shipping Creative Suite 3 today. This is the first version that supports Intel based Macintosh systems. So all of the people who have been whining that Photoshop had to run in emulation on Intel Macs can stop now.

I have not purchased a Intel Mac, but I have no excuses now to not purchase one.
