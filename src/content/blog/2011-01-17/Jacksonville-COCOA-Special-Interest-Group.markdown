I am involved with the [Jacksonville Developers User Group](http://www.jaxdug.com), and I am helping plan the upcoming [jaxcodecamp](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com). I have herd from some of the members planning the Code Camp that there is some interest in a COCOA Special Interest Group. COCOA makes up the set of APIs that are used to program the Mac OS X and the iPhone.

Let me know if you are interested in the a COCOA SIG if you live in the Jacksonville area.
