I have been recently approached by two different companies in the Jacksonville, Fl area that are trying to hire ColdFusion developers. If you live in Jacksonville or are willing to relocate, these are good opportunities.

There are three open positions at [Taleo](http://www.taleo.com/). If you follow this [link](https://taleo.taleo.net/careersection/2/jobsearch.ftl?lang=en) and do a search for "Software Engineer" it will show the open positions. They are also trying to hire Java, C# and Flex developers.

Another company that is trying find ColdFusion developers is called [Andromeda Systems](http://www.androsysinc.com/Company/Careers.aspx).
