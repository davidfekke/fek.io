I have been at the managers conference in San Jose this week that Adobe holds for user group managers. This is the first managers conference I have been to in about four years.

If you have ever thought about becoming a user group manager, I highly suggest becoming one. Macromedia, now Adobe, requires that managers sign a NDA. The managers do get to learn about technology that Adobe has not made available to the general public.

This week Adobe has given us presentations from Kevin Lynch, Ben Forta and Mike Downey. Some of the presentations have covered existing versions of products that Adobe is working on, but they have also covered Apollo.

Adobe has published an [F.A.Q. ](http://labs.adobe.com/wiki/index.php/Apollo:developerfaq) on Apollo. You will see a lot on this from Adobe over the next months. They plan on doing a big presentation on Apollo at [MAX](http://www.adobe.com/events/max/sessions/ri101w.html) this year. If you are going to be at MAX, you defineatly want to check it out.
