I went to the annual Jacksonville codecamp here in Jax this past weekend. This was a free Microsoft event. There were several presentations on SQL Server 2005 and N-tiered Architecture that I attended.

Microsoft recently had a codecamp in the Tampa Bay area as well. If Microsoft is having one in your area, this well worth the day. We use .NET for some internal applications at my present job. Even if you do not use .NET, there were many other compelling technologies that Microsoft was showing off. Some of these were SSIS, analysis services, the Atlas Ajax library and Biztalk server.
