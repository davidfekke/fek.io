I have been watching some of the presentations at Charlie Arehart's [UGTV](http://www.carehart.org/ugtv/) web site. Charlie has added this site were people can place the links to their breeze presentations. There are some excellent presentations there to watch. Breeze presentations are a great way to learn about new subjects if you are unable to attend these presentations in person.

Keep up the good work Charlie.
