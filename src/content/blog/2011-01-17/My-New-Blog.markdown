Ok, I know I had a blog before, but it was really lame. I do not plan on copying over any of my old posts. I do plan on starting to add lots of new content to this website.

My primary focus of this blog is Web application development, with a focus on CFML and SOAP. I also plan on adding an articles section very soon as well. I will also be focusing more on other subjects like BlueDragon, ASP.net, AJAX, Flash MX, Java, Design Patterns as well as ColdFusion MX. I am also planning on adding a code section where people can download copies of applications I have written.

This application was written by Raymond Camden. It is called BlogCFC. It will work with ColdFusion or BlueDragon. His blog and downloads can be found [here](http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/).
