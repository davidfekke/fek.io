I was not able to attend Ben Forta's keynote or CFUnited this year. Part of the keynote this morning was on the new features in ColdFusion 8, but they also went over performance gains in ColdFusion 8.

[Ben Forta](http://www.forta.com) has [posted](http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/6/27/ColdFusion-8-Performance-Numbers) numbers on his blog. Looks like the performance increases will be worth the price upgrade alone.
