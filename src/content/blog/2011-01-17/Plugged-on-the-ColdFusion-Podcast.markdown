Bryan Kaiser and Michael Haynie plugged my website again on the last episode of the [Coldfusionpodcast](http://www.coldfusionpodcast.com). This last episode covered the Fusion debug tool for eclipse. If have thought about using a more traditional debugger with ColdFusion, Michael and Bryan give an overview of this new tool. They even managed to pronounce my last name correctly. Thank Guys.
