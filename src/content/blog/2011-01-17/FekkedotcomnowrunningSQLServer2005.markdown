My web site is running on SQL Server 2005! I wish I could take credit for it, but my service provider, [Mercury New Media](http://www.mecurynewmedia.com), just upgraded to SQL Server 2005 for most of their customers.

I have been running 2005 locally for about a year now, so it is nice to have my personal site running on 2005 as well.

No one should really notice this change because it is on the backend, but it will be nice future development.
