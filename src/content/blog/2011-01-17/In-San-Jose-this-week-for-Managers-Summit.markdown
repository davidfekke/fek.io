I am in San Jose, CA for the Adobe Managers Summit. This is my first time in Silicon Valley. The last time I was in this area of california was about 16 years ago.

The first and last days of the summit include Flex training. I am looking forward to using Flex in my future applications. I already have several planned that could benefit from rich internet front ends.
