Yes, I listen to podcasts. I was listening to [Diggnation](http://revision3.com/diggnation) this weekend, the companion podcast for the [Digg.com](http://digg.com) web site. For those not familiar with this site, it was started by Kevin Rose of Tech TV fame as a way for users to vote for which stories get promoted to the front page of the site. On this weeks episode, Kevin mentioned that the sponsor of the show this week was Adobe Apollo. He even went into the detail of how Apollo uses web technologies to create cross platform desktop applications.

Kevin also mentioned that Digg was looking into using Apollo for future applications.

I think it is great that Adobe is using this type of marketing because it directly targets the audience they need to reach which is technophiles.
