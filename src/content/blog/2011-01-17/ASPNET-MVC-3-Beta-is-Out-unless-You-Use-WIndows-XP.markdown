I was reading Scott Guthrie's blog [post](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/10/06/announcing-nupack-asp-net-mvc-3-beta-and-webmatrix-beta-2.aspx) about the just released ASP.NET MVC 3 Beta. So I decided to download the bits, and get MVC running on my Windows XP box only to find out that it will not run due to a dependency on the ASP.NET Web Pages. MVC 3 preview did run on Windows XP.

I know Microsoft no longer wants to support OSs older than Vista, but unfortuneatly the version of an OS that a developer uses is determined by their IT department. I spoke to a Microsoft Developer evangelist about not supporting Windows XP for upcoming developer tools, and he told me I should take that up with my IT department.

Many large companies skipped Windows Vista, opting to continue to use XP. Even though Windows 7 has been more widely accepted, it has been out for less than a year. Many companies will not deploy a new version of Windows until Service Pack 1 has been released. This has left many developers in a black hole, where they cannot upgrade their tools due to policies set by their companies.
