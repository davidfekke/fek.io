 I switched to a new web host yesterday. My previous site was written in ColdFusion. [This](http://www.fekke.com) site is written in [ASP.NET MVC](http://asp.net/mvc). I really like this new framework from Microsoft. I have not abandoned ColdFusion, but for the last few years I have been developing for .NET. I felt that it made since to switch my site over to .NET since that what I have been using for most of my development.

I am using [BlogEngine.NET](http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/) for my blogging software. I looked at [Oxite](http://www.codeplex.com/oxite), but it was still in beta when I looked at it.
