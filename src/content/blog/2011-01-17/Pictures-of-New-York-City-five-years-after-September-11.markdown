I just got back from a trip to New Jersey to participate in the FISA World Rowing championships. While I was there I had a chance to go into New York City for the day on Friday the 8th.

Here is a [link](http://www.fekke.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewImageList&directory=2006_0907) to the pictures I took while I was in Manhattan. I have been to Ground Zero before. I was there about a two and half years ago. From what I understand, it has not changed at all since the last time I was there, so I decided to go to other places in the city this time.

One of the feelings I got walking around the city was a strong sense of freedom and optimism. You almost would not know that there was an attack there five years ago. It was warm day with lots of sunshine. It felt a little more like Florida then the North East.

If you have not had a chance to visit New York, I would highly recommend visiting. I plan on going back soon.
