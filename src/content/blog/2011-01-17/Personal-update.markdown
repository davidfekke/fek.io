I have not been blogging much over the last month. I have had a few funerals and weddings that I have been attending. I have recently switched jobs. I was working for Idea Integration as a Microsoft Consultant, mainly around SharePoint and SQL Server consulting, but I left them at the end of last month. By the way, if you are looking for SQL Server or SharePoint consulting, go with [Idea Integration](http://www.idea.com).

I am now working as a .NET developer for [HCR Software](http://www.hcrss.com) in Jacksonville. We build web based software for Human Resources.

I hope to blog more about .NET, but I am still active in the ColdFusion and Flex space. I plan on having meetings next month for JaxFusion user group on Flex and ColdFusion.
