The next JaxFusion meeting will be on Tuesday, September 5th at Vurv. I will be doing a presentation on Fusebox 5 vs. Model-Glue framework.

This presentation will be more of a side by side comparison of the two frameworks. It seems like there is no shortage of web application frameworks nowadays. I am also a fan of Mach-II, but I have not taken a look at any of the other frameworks for ColdFusion. There is a new framework called CF on wheels, kind of a spin on Ruby on Rails.
