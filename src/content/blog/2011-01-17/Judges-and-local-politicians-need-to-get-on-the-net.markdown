I was listening to the ColdFusion Weekly podcast a while back, and Matt Woodward mentioned that he worked on the Dean campaign. The Dean campaign was very innovative when it came to using the internet for their campaign.

Now all presidential and other national candidates use the internet for their campaigns. Nancy Pelosi has even posted videos onto YouTube. Unfortunately, local politicians and Judges do not use the internet. Local politicians and judges have a much greater affect on our lives than national politicians. Only two judicial candidates had websites. How hard is it for a city councilman to get a blogger account or post a video onto YouTube explaining their positions on issues.

Every local politician needs to have a website at a minimum. There is no excuse not to with sites like blogger and MySpace.
