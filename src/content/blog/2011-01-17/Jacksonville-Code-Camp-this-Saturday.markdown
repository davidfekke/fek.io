The [Jacksonville CodeCamp](http://codecamp07.jaxdug.com/) is this Saturday at the FCCJ Advanced Technology Center campus in downtown Jacksonville. I am going to be giving a presentation on Excel Services, and how to integrate them into your applications.

I went to the Code Camp in Tampa last month. These are great events because they cover a broad range of different Microsoft technologies. This year their are a lot of sessions on SQL Server 2005 and Rich Client Apps.
