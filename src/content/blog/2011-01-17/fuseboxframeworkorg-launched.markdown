I have been lite blogging lately. I have been preparing for FISA world rowing championships in Princeton, NJ.

I read today on Sean Corfield's blog that Fuseboxframework.org website is up now as well as a SVN and bugtrak site.

The Mach-II 1.1.1 beta has also been released as well, so I will have to check that out.
