Having been a resident of the Tampa Bay area for a long time, 22 years, one of the things I was proud of was that Wikipedia was based out of St. Petersburg, FL. I [read](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/11/BU69SNMQ2.DTL) recently that the foundation is moving its office's from St. Pete to San Francisco.

I am sorry to see Jimbo and the gang moving out of state, but I can certainly understand why they are moving. According to the article, they are "moving to San Francisco in an attempt to create a larger brand, attract more talent and make better inroads in developing countries, particularly in Asia". 

As for me, I am happy staying here in the Sunshine state.
