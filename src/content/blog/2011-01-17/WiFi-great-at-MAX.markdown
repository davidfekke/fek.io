I am starting my last day at MAX. I have to say the WiFI access at the conference is really good. I have had better access to the internet here than I do on my home WiFi network.

All in all, this is one of the best organizied conferences I have been too. Kudos to Macromedia.

I am looking forward to my next couple of Flex sessions. More posts soon.
