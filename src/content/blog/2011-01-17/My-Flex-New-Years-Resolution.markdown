I have been pretty good to sticking to my New Year's resolutions in the past. This is not because I have some great resolve, but because I pick easy goals. For instance, "I am going to buy a new laptop this year". The tough ones are like quiting smoking or losing 15 pounds.

Since I like to pick easy ones, I have picked one that I think will be attainable to me. My New Year's resolution is to become more proficient at Flex.

This will be a big year for Flex. A lot of this has to do with Apollo being released soon. Apollo will make it easy to take existing Flex/Flash content, and turn it into double click-able applications.

I am also planning on having more Flex and Flash presentations being made at the JaxFusion User Group this year as well.
