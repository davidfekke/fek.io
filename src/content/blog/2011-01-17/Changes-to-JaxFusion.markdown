Last week Vince Bonfanti and Josh Adams came out to the [JaxFusion](http://www.jaxfusion.org) user group to present on the next version of BlueDragon. The presentation was excellent, and I hope we can have back again. As good as the presentation was, we had a much lower turnout than I would have liked. Because of the turnout, I sent out a list of questions to the members of the user group who work internally at Vurv to get feedback. Not every member of the [JaxFusion](http://www.jaxfusion.org) user group works at Vurv, so I decided to post these questions to my blog.

Please feel free to leave comments on this blog post with answers to these questions;

What do you want to see at future meetings? 

Is there a better meeting time that would be more convenient for most members? 

Would you prefer a different day of the week for the meetings?

Would you like to have lunchtime meetings?

Are there subjects you would like to see covered which are not being covered by the group?

One idea has been to do Study Groups. Would anybody be interested in Study Groups for Flash, Flex, Apollo or ColdFusion 8?
