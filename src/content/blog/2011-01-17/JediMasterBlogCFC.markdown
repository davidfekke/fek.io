I had the pleasure to watch a presentation that Raymond Camden gave at MAX this week on the ColdFusion application.cfc component framework.

Raymond amoung many other things is the creater of BlogCFC. BlogCFC is by far the most popular Blog software for ColdFusion and BlueDragon. My blog is running on this software, and as I told Ray at MAX the software I wrote for my blog before "sucked". Ray's is much better than mine, hence why I am using his code. Ray also told me he is trying keep tract of all of the sites that are using BlogCFC so he can list links to them on his site.

Ray's regular [blog](http://www.camdenfamily.com/morpheus/blog/) is a very good source for ColdFusion related information.
