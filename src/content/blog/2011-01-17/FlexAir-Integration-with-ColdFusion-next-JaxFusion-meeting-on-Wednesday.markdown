It has been awhile since the last JaxFusion meeting. We are [meeting](http://www.jaxfusion.org/meeting.cfm) at Southwest Signal next Wednesday. I will be giving a presentation on integrating ColdFusion with Flex and Air applications.

There have been a lot of changes in the ColdFusion community in the last couple of months and I am looking forward to meeting up with the developers in the group.
