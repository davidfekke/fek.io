Ben Forta posted on his [blog](http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm?mode=e&entry=1730) about how the Macromedia is supporting the CFEclipse project. Damon Cooper is leading an effort to support RDS in the Eclipse IDE.

If you have not tried Eclipse yet, I highly recommend downloading it from eclipse.org. It is a open source and free IDE with a plugin system that allows anyone to add additional funtionality to it.

It looks like Macromedia is trying to point designers back at Dreamweaver, and point coders to Eclipse.
