Many of you know that I work at _Recruitmax Software_. We just changed our name today to _[Vurv Technology, Inc.](http://www.vurv.com)_. This is an important change for our company as we continue to expand our business. Here is a link to a [press release](http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/02-28-2006/0004308019&EDATE=).

It is a lot of work to get your brand established, so to avoid confusion we will go by _Vurv Technology, formerly Recruitmax Software_.

I would like to say congratulations to our Marketing team, they have worked very hard to make this happen.
