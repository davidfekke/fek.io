Adobe has been up to trouble for the last three days. They have launched a new [developer site](http://developer.adobe.com), new updates to the [AIR](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/logged_in/mchambers_air_beta.html) and [Flex 3](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flex/) betas.

I hope to have several presentations coming out based on these technologies future JaxFusion meetings.
