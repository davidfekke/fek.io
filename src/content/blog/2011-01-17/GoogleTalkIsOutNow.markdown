[Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/) was released today. This is HUGE! AOL, YAHOO and MSN have dominated the IM space for years. I have heard from users that if Google released an IM client, they would use it over AIM or MSN messenger.

That being said, what is really important about this is that Google Talk uses Jabber. Jabber is an open standard for Instant Messaging. If Google Talk takes off, it will acheive something that corporate IT departments have wished for for years, a standard IM protocol. Linux and Mac users can use this service with their IM clients because it is uses Jabber. I was able to sign up last night using my iChat AV client because Jabber is a supported protocol.

ColdFusion Event Gateways also supports the Jabber protocol. Expect to see a lot of application using this Google Client. I know I will be writting some in the near future.
