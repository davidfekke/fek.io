About five months back I started working as consultant for a company called Idea Integration based here in Jacksonville. I have been doing SQL Server consulting since I arrived. The group I work in specializes in Microsoft technologies, including SQL Server, ASP .NET, BizTalk and Sharepoint. We also do consulting in legacy systems, network infrastructure and Java.

I just finished up a project, and I am available for consulting work. If you would like to contact me for consulting work, you can reach me be going to this [link](http://www.fekke.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.contactMe).
