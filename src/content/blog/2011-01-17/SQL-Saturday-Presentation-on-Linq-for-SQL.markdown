I am going to be giving a presentation on Linq for SQL at the [SQL Saturday](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/eventhome.aspx?eventid=19) at the University of North Florida on Saturday May 2nd. This presentation covers the basics on how to use the Language integrated query syntax inside of .NET 3.5.

There a lot of other good presentations that will be given on the SQL Server 2008 platform. SQL Saturday is a free event. Sign up now before registration for the event fills up.
