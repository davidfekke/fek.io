January 14 â€“28th are the 14 days of [jQuery](http://jquery14.com/). If you are not familiar with jQuery, it is a highly popular open source Javascript framework. Microsoft is now including jQuery with new editions of Visual Studio. John Resig and other developers are giving presentations on new features that are being included with version 1.4 at the [14 days of jQuery](http://jquery14.com/) site.

One of the changes in this coming release is a new [API documentation site](http://api.jquery.com) for jQuery. This site has a [listing](http://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.4/) of the new and changed functions in jQuery.
