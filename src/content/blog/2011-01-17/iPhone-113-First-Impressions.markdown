I got home last night and installed the latest iPhone update, version 1.1.3\. This update includes a new version of the Google Maps with a location aware feature. This uses triangulation from Cell towers to find your position on the map. This works well enough that I am planning using this instead of getting hand held GPS.

One of the other cool features is the ability to reorganize icons on the home screen and even create additional screens.

On the downside, the Uconnect feature still does not work with the bluetooth in the iPhone. I was hoping Apple would fix this, but it still fails to complete the calls.
