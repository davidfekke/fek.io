Tim Buntel stepped down recently from the senior product manager role at Adobe. Tim came and spoke at my user group in Tampa when ColdFusion MX was first released. He is defineatly leaving some big shoes to fill at Adobe.

Adobe announced yesterday that Jason Delmore is the new senior product manager for ColdFusion. Jason previously worked for a company that is a competitor of the company I work for now, so needless to say, I am glad he is working at Adobe now.

Good luck Jason!
