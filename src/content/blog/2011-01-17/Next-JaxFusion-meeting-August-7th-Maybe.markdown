The next [JaxFusion User Group](http://www.jaxfusion.org) meeting should be held on August 7th at the Modis building in downtown Jacksonville. I am still trying to schedule a conference room, but we should still be meeting around August 7th.

We will be covering some of the new features in Adobe ColdFusion 8\. I found out at the Tampa Code Camp last week that my service provider, [Mercury New Media](http://www.mercurynewmedia.com), will be upgrading to ColdFusion 8 once it is released.
