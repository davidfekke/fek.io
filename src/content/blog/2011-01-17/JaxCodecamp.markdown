I attended a Microsoft sponsored codecamp in Jacksonville, FL today. If you have one of these in your local area, I highly suggest attending. They covered all of the .NET 2.0 stuff as well as VS.net 2005 and SQL Server 2005.

We use SQL Server at my present job, and I am a big fan of DTS Packages for performing data tranformations for exporting and importing data. Microsoft has completely rewritten this tool as a Visual Studio tool called SSIS (SQL Server 2005 Integration

Services). 

You can use conditional logic to handle failures and loop through transformations. This can all be done from a Drag and Drop GUI interface. It does support scripting with VB.NET.
