I have been developing almost exclusively in C# .net for about a year now. In that time, I have wished for some of the language functionality in ColdFusion to find its way into C#. I have been using Visual Studio 2008 since it came out, and I found a project that is used to test Linq called ObjectDumper. It compiles a class called ObjectDumper that can be used for dumping the value of just about any object into a command line. Here is some sample syntax;

```csharp
using System; 
using System.Collections.Generic;  
using System.Linq;   
using System.Text; 

namespace DumperTest { 

	class Program 
	{ 
		static void Main(string[] args) 
		{ 
			var myObject = new[]  
			{ 
				new { Name = "Chris Smith", 
				PhoneNumbers = new[] { "206-555-0101", "425-882-8080" } 
				}, 
					new { Name = "Bob Harris", 
					PhoneNumbers = new[] { "650-555-0199" } 
				}	 
			}; 
			var myPets = new[] 
			{ 
				new { name = "Spike", number=9 }, 
				new { name = "Snoopy", number=7 } 
			}; 
				ObjectDumper.Write(myObject); 
				ObjectDumper.Write(myPets); 
			} 
		} 
	} 
}
```
