Apple released a whole bunch of new software and hardware today. Part of that is Motorola is releasing a phone that will work with the iTunes Music store. The service will be provided by Cingular.

They also released iTunes 5.0 today as well. You can create multi-level playlists, and overall, it seems a lot faster on Windows. They also included Outlook integration. Hoorah!!!

They came out with a new Mini replacement. The iPod nano replaces the harddrive with Flash memory. It also has a color screen. Very cool. I am thinking about picking one up.
