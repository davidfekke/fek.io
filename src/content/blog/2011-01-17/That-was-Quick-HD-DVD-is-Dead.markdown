I made a blog post over the weekend that Engadget said that they were putting HD DVD on a Death Watch. Today [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2008/02/18/toshiba-expected-to-announce-death-of-hd-dvd-tomorrow-stop-sale/) says that Toshiba will announce tomorrow that they are officially killing HD DVD.

Most likely Toshiba will start manufacturing Blu-ray players. There has been speculation in the tech press that Microsoft pressured Toshiba to create a competing format with Sony to screw up sales of the Playstation 3\. I am skeptical about Microsoft pressuring Toshiba, but there is another post on Engadget today saying that Microsoft will not add Blu-Ray support for the Xbox 360.

In the mean time I am going to see if I can find a playstation 3\.
