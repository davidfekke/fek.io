I received an email from a friend of mine I used to work with in Tampa. He is reforming our old user group as the Tampa Bay Adobe User Group. They are going to be meeting at the International Academy of Design and Technology in Tampa. They will be covering a whole slew of products from Macromedia and Adobe.
