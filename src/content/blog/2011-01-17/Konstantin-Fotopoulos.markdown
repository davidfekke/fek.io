When I lived in Daytona Beach about 17 years ago, there were some pretty famous murders. Konstantin Fotopoulos was tried and sent to Death Row for the murder of a hit-man he hired to kill his wife, and for planning the murder of a vagrant.

Fotopoulos just won a new penalty phase, and is off of Florida's Death Row.

I normally do not blog about this stuff, but it is not often I can scoop major news outlets.
