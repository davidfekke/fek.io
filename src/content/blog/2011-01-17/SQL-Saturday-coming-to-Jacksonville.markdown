[SQL Saturday](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/default.aspx) is coming to Jacksonville on Saturday May 3rd, 2008\. The conference will be held at the UNF campus.

The SQL Saturday conferences encompass one hour sessions on SQL Server and technologies used in conjunction with SQL Server. 

I will be giving a couple of presentations this year at this conference. You can go and register now, and the registration is free.
