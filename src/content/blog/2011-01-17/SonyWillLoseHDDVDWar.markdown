This definitely will follow my own personal opinion on technology. If you have been living on another planet for the last year, you might have heard that there is a format war ala VHS vs. Betamax.

The two competing standards are a high def format from Toshiba and Sony's Blue Ray DVD. Toshiba's format, HD DVD, can store 15 gigabyte's on a layer while Sony's Blue Ray will store 25 gigabytes on a layer. Blue Ray also allows your DVD interactive content to be programmed with Java. Blue Ray also has better content protection that will allow consumers to copy Blue Ray content to other types of players. The only negative I have seen so far is that the media for Blue Ray is easier to scratch, but a solution has been found for that already.

With all of that being said, Sony will lose. Every new format that Sony has come out with has been a Sony only format. Betamax was a Sony format, and it failed. Betamax is still used at television studios because the quality is much higher than VHS.

I hope I am wrong. Sony has gotten a few studios to come to their side along with a few prominent Computer companies. Unfortunately, consumers usually buy the cheaper technology. As a developer, it would be nice to see a format that uses Java win.

Good Luck Sony.
