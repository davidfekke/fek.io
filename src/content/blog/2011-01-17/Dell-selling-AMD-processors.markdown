I saw a CNET article today that Dell was selling some individual AMD processors, as if Dell was testing the waters. They still do not sell PCs with AMD processors, but they may be looking to change that now. My company only bought Dell computers for the longest time. Recently, we have started breaking away from that practice. Some of people at my company use Macs. We also have some higher end laptops and servers using AMD processors.

I think since Dell is seeing a slowdown in their business, they are taking a second look at AMD processors. AMD always seems to win the speed tests in the desktop and x86 based servers. Even Sun is using AMD processors in their x86 servers.
