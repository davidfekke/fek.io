I heard about this today on the CF-Talk list. There is a survey about what ColdFusion developers would like to see in a IDE if one were to be developed by Adobe. Here is your chance to [let Adobe know what you want](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=321RrO9_2fWaP_2bdYMnmF9CuQ_3d_3d) in an IDE for ColdFusion.

I personally use CFEclipse and enjoy using that more than DreamWeaver or Homesite.
