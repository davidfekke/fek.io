Microsoft dropped the Office Sharepoint Server 1.2 SDK last month which included a tool for generating Application LobSystem files for creating Business Data Catalog (BDC) applications. The BDC can connect to database resources or Web Services.

The BDC tool allows you to specify a connection string or a WSDL document for creating the LobSystem xml files. Their is a [tutorial](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb737887.aspx) on MSDN explaining how to use the Web Services to create BDC methods and entities.
