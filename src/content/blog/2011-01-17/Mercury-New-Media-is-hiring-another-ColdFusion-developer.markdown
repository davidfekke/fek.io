Mercury New Media is hiring another ColdFusion developer in the Tampa Bay Area. Mercury New Media also hosts this website. Check out the Ad below.



    Mercury New Media is a Tampa-based web development shop and we are currently hiring for a ColdFusion Developer position. A mid- to high-level ColdFusion developer would fit well with the team and experience with Fusebox is a must. In addition to working with the ColdFusion 8 platform and Flex applications we are also actively integrating ColdFusion with .NET applications. This would be an excellent position for any ColdFusion developer looking to also expand into .NET development.

If you are interested or know anyone that would fit this position, please email Donald Bickel at dbickel@mercurynewmedia.com.
