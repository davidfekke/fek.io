Congratulations to the Tampa Bay Rays on their ALCS pennant win yesterday. I have been a fan of the Rays since their inaugural season in 1998\. After nine seasons of being in the baseball basement, all I have to say is this feels good.

I have a number of friends who live in Boston who I know are not feeling well this morning about their Red Sox. The first baseball game I ever saw was in Fenway Park, and I rooted for Boston over the Yankees in 2004 when Boston came back from being three games down to beat the Yanks. The Red Sox are a great team, but this was not to be their year, it is Tampa's.

At the beginning of the season, the Tampa Bay Rays were 200/1 to win the World Series. It has been one wild ride this year. Joe Maddon deserves a ton of credit for turning the Rays around, along with the new ownership. 

After listening to the Bob Costas' of the world bad mouth my home team for the last ten years, it is nice to see them host the 2008 World Series in my home town of Tampa.
