Damon Cooper has posted [new versions](http://www.dcooper.org/blog/client/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=A71F310C-4E22-1671-5E287AE8918A048B) of the CFThread and CFJoin tags developed by Rupesh Kumar. These tags are proof of concept tags, so not for production use yet. I hope they add this into ColdFusion. Very cool guys.
