The aerospace system in this county is not getting any better, it is getting worse. I am currently waiting on standby for another flight, because the connection was too late to the airport. And it does not look like I will get on this flight either.

It has become almost impossible to fly across the country from regoinal airports, like the one in my current home city of Jacksonville.
