Was it Sir Tim? I have always been curious who the developer was who misspelled referrer. The 'Referer' in the http cgi is the variable that represents the site or page you came from originally. In ColdFusion you can access this variable with cgi.HTTP_Referer.

Spelling has never been one of my strong points, and anyone who reads this blog on a regular basis knows this already. I was always curious who the developer was who misspelled referrer. And is it actually misspelled if he developer was from a country where referer is the correct spelling?
