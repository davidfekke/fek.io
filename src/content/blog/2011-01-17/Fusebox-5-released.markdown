I don't know how I missed this, but Fusebox 5 general release is available at [fusebox.org](http://www.fusebox.org).

Congratulations to Sean Corfield and the rest of the Fusebox group for getting this release out. I have been beta testing the framework for a new application I have been working on for last couple of weeks.

This is the first release of the Fusebox framework that has not required a rewrite of your application to upgrade the framework. All fusebox.xml and circuit.xml files will run as they did in version 4.0 and 4.1.

The core files are now CFCs for the most part. There is also a new fusebox.loadclean keyword that can be used to recompile the app from the xml files.
