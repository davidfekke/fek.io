I have been reading a lot of negative comments today about the new Google Finance site that Google added today. I guess Google is starting to loose some of their mind share.

I like Google Finance so far, but mostly because of the technologies that they are using to implement this new site. Google Finance makes heavy use of Flash widgets and AJAX. The Stock chart is linked to the headlines, so if you select a sudden drop in the share price, the headlines change to correspond to the dates of the drop. Very cool!

I have been giving Google a hard time about some of their business decisions, but I think they deserve credit for their engineering. It is nice to see that Google is using Flash.

On that note, I am giving a presentation on AJAX at the next JaxFusion user group meeting.
