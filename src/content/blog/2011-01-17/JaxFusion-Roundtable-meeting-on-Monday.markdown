The JaxFusion user group is having its next meeting this Monday. Here is a description of the meeting;

This meeting we will be discussing JaxFusion and how it can best meet the needs of the Jacksonville ColdFusion User Community going foward. JaxFusion has been in place for a year and a half now and has had some great speakers and events, and the coming years can even be greater!

This will be an open forum to express what you'd like to see JaxFusion provide for the community as well as how you might be willing to assist in improving and developing JaxFusion into a top notch User Group Community. We look forward to seeing everyone visit with some creative and fun ways to improve JaxFusion.
