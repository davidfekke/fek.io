Calvin Ward asked me if I would become the new JaxFusion User Group manager this week, and I accepted.

I used to manage the Macromedia User Group in Tampa and really enjoyed my work with that group. I am looking forward to managing the group in Jacksonville. There is a terrific community of developers and engineers in this area. I also wanted to thank Calvin Ward, Steve "Gus" Gustafson and James Ahrens for doing such a great job of starting and running the club.
