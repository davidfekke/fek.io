I went to Dave Ross's presentation on ColdSpring at CFUNITED. It was an extremely informative presentation on the ColdSpring frame work that Dave developed. ColdSpring is based on the Java Spring framework. It makes it much easier to create service factories for creating objects. It also includes a framework for Aspect Oriented Programming.

Dave mentioned that the examples that are always given of AOP are logging and security, but it can also be used for managing transactions as well as caching.
