Right now I only have one application on the Apple App Store, but I am planning on releasing more applications. According to Apple, iPhone applications will run unmodified on the iPad. Apple released a new SDK for the iPhone and iPad today.

The new iPhone/iPad SDK is version 3.2\. Many speculated it would be version 4.0, but they may be saving those features for this Summer. The iPad will cost $499, $599 and $799 for the WiFi only versions, and $629, $729 and $829 for the WiFi/3G versions. Flash memory sizes will range from 16 GB to 64 GB.
