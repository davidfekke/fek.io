title: "File Explorer changes in CFEclipse causes problems in Flex Builder"

I upgraded to the new version of CFEclipse this morning to 1.3.1.1\. The changes that have been made since 1.3 have been changes to the File Explorer. I am not using the regular version of Eclipse, I am using Flex Builder 3.0.1\. I think this is probably why I might be having problems with the File Explorer in CFEclipse.

When I upgraded to CFEclipse 1.3.1.1, the File Explorer will not come up in either the Flex perspective or the CFEclipse perspective.
