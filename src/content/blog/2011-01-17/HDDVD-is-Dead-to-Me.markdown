I am a big fan of open standards. One of the things that has prevented me from upgrading to a HDTV and a new high def player is that lack of a high def format standard.

There have been two camps for the last couple of years for high def video players, Toshiba's HD-DVD and Sony's Blu-Ray. This past weekend Warner Brothers anounced that they were going drop support for HD-DVD and go with Blu-Ray exclusively. I read today on [engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/07/paramount-following-warner-out-the-hd-dvd-door/) that Paramount was switching to Blu-Ray. That leaves only one major studio behind HD-DVD, that being Universal, and I am sure Universal will drop support as well.

I have not purchased one of these players yet because I did not want to get _Betamaxed_. I will probably buy a Blu-Ray player now, I am even thinking about getting a Play Station 3\.
