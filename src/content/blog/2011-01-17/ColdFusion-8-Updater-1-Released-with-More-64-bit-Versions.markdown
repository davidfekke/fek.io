Adobe has released the [ColdFusion 8 updater 1](http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb403277&sliceId=1). This contains some hot-fixes, but the real news is that Adobe has released 64 bit version for Windows, Linux and Mac OS 10.5.

Previously the only 64 bit version of ColdFusion ran on Solaris only. If you have been running any server software on 64 bit hardware, you have probably seen improvements in permormance and memory usage.

For Mac OS X users, the installer will now work with 10.5\. All of my Macs are now using 64 bit hardware with Mac OS X 10.5\. 10.5 also comes pre-installed with Apache 2.2
