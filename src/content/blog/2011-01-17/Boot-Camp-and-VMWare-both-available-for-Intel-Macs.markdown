When Apple first announced the MacBook Pro earlier this year, I thought about ordering one then, but decided against buying one for several reasons. One is that I just bought a PowerMac last year before the announcement. Another reason is I use my current laptop for my DBA work, and SQL Server is my primary database. A couple of weeks ago someone came out with a way to dual boot a Mac with Windows. Then yesterday Apple announced the beta of Boot Camp which essentially does the same thing.

This is all good news, but What I really need to be able to do is use the Mac OS for my development, and run my SQL code on Windows at the same time on the same machine. Ideally having an Windows image on a Mac so I can have Windows sandboxed as much as possible.

Today Parellels announced the beta of [Parallels Workstation 2.1](http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/mac/). I am going to try to scrape together funds now to buy one of the MacBook Pros. This is what I have been waiting for. Now I just need to find someone to buy my old PowerPC based Macs.
