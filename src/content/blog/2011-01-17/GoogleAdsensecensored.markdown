I try to avoid making statements if I can get away with it, but I am making an exception in this case. I have been using Google Adsense since last year.

Google just made a "Business Decision" to launch the chinese version of their search service, google.cn. One of the things that they had to do was to censor their search results in order operate in China. I do not oppose any person or business who wants to do business in China. I just bought a racing shell that was partially manufactured in China. I do oppose censorship and hypocrisy. 

Google's moto is "Do no evil". Censoring information because it contains words like "Freedom" or "Democracy" is evil.

This is why I made a "Business Decision" to no longer use Google Adsense. I am not sure if I will replace the advertising with something else.
