I was lucky enough to get a BlackBerry for XMas this year. It is a 7100, and is part of a plan with Cingular. I have had a Nokia 3650 for the last three years. My first complaint is the BB did not come with a camera. I have made good use of my camera in my Nokia.

I was able to sync all of my old contacts over to the BlackBerry, but it seems to chock on the calendar for some reason.

I am excited by the email features, and I will have playing with the other features.
