Ben Forta, Raymond Camden and Charlie Arehart have released the first volume of the [WACK](http://forta.com/books/032166034X/ "WACK") for ColdFusion 9\. According to Ben Forta's blog, they waited to release the book until ColdFusion Builder was released.

I do not do much ColdFusion programming anymore, but these books are the defacto standard books for ColdFusion programming. Sometimes referred to as the "Forta" books, they are a must have if you use ColdFusion.
