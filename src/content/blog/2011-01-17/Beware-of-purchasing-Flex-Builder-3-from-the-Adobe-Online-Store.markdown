I purchased the Flex Builder upgrade today from the Adobe Online Store. When I went to find the serial number for my download, I was presented by a 'Contact Customer Service'.

So I contacted Adobe's Customer Service, and they said it would take 24 hours to provide me with a serial number. You may not want to purchase this from Adobe until this gets worked out in their online store.

**Update**

According to Matt Chotin, all of the serial number issues have been resolved with the online store, so it should be safe to buy online.
