If you are looking to hire experienced ColdFusion developers, I know two ColdFusion developers who have been working at NASA. Their contracts are up at the end of this month. They are currently based in the Cape/Orlando area of Florida.

If you know of any opportunities in Orlando area, or remote ones, please contact me, and I can put you in touch with these developers.

My contact email is [davidfekke@gmail.com](mailto:davidfekke@gmail.com).
