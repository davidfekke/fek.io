I was looking at some more information on Dreamweaver 8, and it looks like they are adding support for xslt. From there website, they state that you can drag and drop XML objects into your template, and Dreamweaver will write the xsl for you.

So far most of the new features look very cool. Macromedia has also added numerous changes to their code editor.
