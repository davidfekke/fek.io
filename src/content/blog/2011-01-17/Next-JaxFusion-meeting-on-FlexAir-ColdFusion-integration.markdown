The fine folks at [SouthWest Signal](http://www.swsignal.com/) will be hosting the next [JaxFusion](http://www.jaxfusion.org) meeting. July's meeting will be covering how to integrate ColdFusion with [Flex/Air applications](http://www.jaxfusion.org/meeting.cfm).

We will be giving away a lot of goodies from Adobe. We hope to make this a regular occurrence again. We are also going to have a presence this year at the [Jacksonville Code Camp](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com).
