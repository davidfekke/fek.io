I have been reading a couple of articles about Mac OS X running on x86 processors as a vmware disk image. If you have been living hole in the ground for the last couple of months, you might have heard that Apple is switching to Intel processors.

The development machines that shipped have the installer disk, and so people have managed to install Mac OS X without the machine level copy protection. My personal opinion about the move to Intel is that is about time. 

As far as Apple selling the Mac OS for any pc, I think that is a bad idea. Apple is a hardware company, and besides that it is a lot easier to develope an operating system if you also make the hardware, rather than trying to make the Mac OS compatible with every piece of hardware out there.

I own a Mac, and do most of my development on the Mac. Mainly because I am fed up with viruses and spyware, but I have always owned a Mac since 1993.
