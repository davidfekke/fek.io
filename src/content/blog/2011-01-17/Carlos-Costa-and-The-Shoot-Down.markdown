I went to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University from 1988 to 1992\. While there I had the opportunity to meet Carlos Costa. Carlos was in the same program I was in which is the Aeronautical Science program where students learn how to become professional pilots.

Carlos went on to fly with Brothers to the Rescue. Brothers to the Rescue flew over the Florida straights in Cessna Skymasters between Florida and Cuban airspace looking for Cuban refugees trying to escape from Cuba. On February 24th, 1996 the Cuban government sent Migs to shoot down Brothers to the Rescue. Carlos and another Embry-Riddle student, Mario De La Pe√±a, where killed while flying in international airspace.

A documentary film has been made about them called ["The Shoot Down"](http://www.theshootdown.com/shootdownweb/index.php). The movie opened this weekend in select theaters. It is playing in Miami and Tampa, but not in Jacksonville where I live.

I did not know Carlos well, but I used to see him all the time at the flight line at Embry-Riddle. I did not meet Mario while he went to Embry-Riddle. I look forward to seeing this movie when it either comes to a theater near me or it comes out on DVD.
