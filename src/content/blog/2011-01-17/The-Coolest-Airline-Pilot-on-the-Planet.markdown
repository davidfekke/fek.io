I have to give thanks to getting home to Jacksonville from CFUNITED to an airline pilot named "Rusty". As my airline experiences have been lately, my flight out of Dulles was delayed. When I finally did get on the plane to fly to Charlotte, I was bemoaning the fact that my connection flight had already left before we took off. The passenger who was in the standby seat behind me was a pilot for the same airline. He told me he was going down to the races in Daytona. I told him I was supposed to go, but I missed my connection.

At this point, "Rusty", offered to give me a ride to Jacksonville once we landed. I accepted his offer, and we drove to Jacksonville from Charlotte. I would not have made it back last night if it had not been for Rusty.

How is that for service. If you are reading this Rusty, you are the coolest airline pilot on the planet!
