I was reading [Ben Forta's blog](http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2008/12/4/The-Changing-ColdFusion-Team) and saw that Jason Delmore, the ColdFusion product manager has been let go from Adobe. He was one of the many people who have been laid off from [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com).

I had the opportunity to meet Jason not too long after he was hired at Adobe. At the time he was hired, I was happy that Adobe hired him because he had been working at a competitor of mine. I found Jason to be good steward for ColdFusion.

While Jason was at Adobe, ColdFusion 8 was released, and ColdFusion 9 has been announced. I have been extremely happy with the new features that have included in 8, and the features announced for 9.

I am sorry that Jason is gone from the ColdFusion team. The product really improved under his tenure. That is not a bad CV. Hey Microsoft, you might want to hire this guy.
