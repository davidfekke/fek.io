The planning has begun for the next [Jacksonville Code Camp](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com/). The next code camp will be this August at the UNF campus. If you are not familiar with the Code Camp, it is a free one day development conference put on by the local development community.

One of the things we tried to do last year was to have differing development technologies presented on at the camp. We had a presentation from the Ruby Jax group, as well as several presentations on Adobe Air and Flex.

The conference is still looking for speakers and volunteers. If there is a subject you would like to present on, please submit your presentation subject at the [web site](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com/).
