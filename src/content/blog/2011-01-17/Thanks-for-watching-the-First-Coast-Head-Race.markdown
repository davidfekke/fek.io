I wanted to thank every family member and friend who came out to watch the First Coast Head Race this past weekend. It was nice having cheering sections on different parts of the river.

Even though I had the lowest time for the masters class, I came in second place. The rower who came in with the next lowest time got first place with his handicapped time. In rowing, we shave seconds off the time based on your age. Since he was older than I was, he got the first place medal.

Several members of the club also won medals, and I wanted congratulate them as well. Everyone trained hard this year and it showed.
