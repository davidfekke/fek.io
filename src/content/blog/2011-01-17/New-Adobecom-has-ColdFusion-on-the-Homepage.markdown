I have seen a lot of blogging this morning about the final merger of Adobe and Macromedia's web sites this morning. The biggest change I have seen is that Adobe now lists ColdFusion on their homepage.

I have been blogging about problems I have seen since the conversion of the two sites started, but I wanted to add I know this has been a ton of work for Adobe. My kudos to Adobe.
