Two of my co-workers, Henry Adam and Sai Kolla, turned me on to some new tools for testing Web Services. The first tools is called [soapUI](http://www.soapui.org/). It is an opensource project for testing SOAP calls and generating SOAP envelopes. They also have plugins for Eclipse, IntelliJ and NetBeans.

They also showed me a full blown testing tool called [Lisa](http://www.itko.com/site/products/lisa/web_services.jsp). This is not an open source tool, but is free to the first 50,000 registered users to download the tool. Lisa will allow to do assertions.
