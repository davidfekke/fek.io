A member of the JaxFusion user group is available for ColdFusion and or Flash development. I used to work with this guy, and he is hands down one of the best Flash developers I have ever worked with in my web development career.

He is based out of the Jacksonville area, and is also available for remote work. Please contact me if you are interested at davidfekke at gmail dot com.
