Yet another open source site!. Apple announced to developers that they have created a [site called macosforge.org](http://www.macosforge.org/). The site contains the source to their iCal server, Darwin streaming server, Bonjour as well as to their WebKit.

Here is some text from their site: "Mac OS Forge is dedicated to supporting the developer community surrounding open source components specific to Mac OS X. Here you will find resources for working with the source code to popular Apple-original projects, as well as third party projects that are closely related to the Macintosh operating system."
