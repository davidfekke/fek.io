I have been on the road a lot lately, so my blogging has been lite lately. I just got back from competing in the South East Regional rowing regatta. Jacksonville came in third overall if you follow rowing.

I found out late last week that I will be attending CFUNITED this week. I look forward to meeting all those people I only see at ColdFusion and Adobe conferences. Then I will be off to the Pepsi 400 to see the race in Daytona this weekend.

I hope to blog on CFUNITED while I am there, but I do not know what the Wi-Fi access will be like.
