title: "Brian Knight Shows Off New Tool for Migrating DTS packages to SSIS"

I read on [Brian Knight's blog](http://www.whiteknighttechnology.com/cs/blogs/brian_knight/archive/2007/09/12/1743.aspx) about a new tool that converts DTS packages to SSIS packages on SQL Server 2005\. Brian says that the built in migration wizard that comes with SQL Server 2005 is only 40% successful, and that it does not follow the best practices for building SSIS packages.

The tool is called [DTS xChange](http://www.pragmaticworks.com/dtsxchange.htm), and is a couple of weeks away from release.
