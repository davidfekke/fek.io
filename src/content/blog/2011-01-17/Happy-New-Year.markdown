2007 has been an exiting year for me because of many changes in my life. The ColdFusion 8 launch was very exiting and has been successful for Adobe. I wish I had more time to devote to the JaxFusion user group this year to cover all of the new features.

I also started a new job working as a technical consultant. I did that to get more hands on experience using the BI features in SQL Server 2005\. I also have had the opportunity to work with Microsoft Sharepoint and .NET this year. It has been great to learn new things related to these other products. 

I just wanted to wish everyone a happy and safe new year.
