Steve Gustafsen has added the ability to subscribe and subscribe from his MXNA bot. This will work with Trillian or the Google Talk client. When updates to MXNA occur, a IM message will pop up with the lastest Macromedia developer articles.

Steve has instructions on how to do this on his [blog](http://blog.geopoly.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=03F8D771-10DC-9683-32C50085B4FBE721).
