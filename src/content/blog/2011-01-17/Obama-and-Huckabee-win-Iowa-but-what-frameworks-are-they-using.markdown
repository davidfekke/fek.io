Congratulations to Barack Obama and Mike Huckabee for winning the Iowa Caucus last night. I was looking at their respective web sites last night. I am not sure which web framework Obama is using, but Mike Huckabee is using Fusebox.

As a long time Fusebox developer I wish all candidates would use Fusebox. It will not affect my vote, but it is still nice to see.
