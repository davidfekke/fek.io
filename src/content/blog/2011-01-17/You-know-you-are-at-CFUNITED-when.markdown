You know you are at CFUNITED when you walk into the hotel and you see Ben Forta, Sean Corfield, Charlie Arehart and Raymond Camden in the first five minutes of being at the hotel. I wish I could say the weather here in Washington was great, but I would be lying. It has been raining non-stop since we arrived. It does not inspire confidence when the cab driver screams in terror several times on the way to the hotel because of the wet driving conditions.

The hotel is actually quite nice, and we have a nice room to watch the rain from.
