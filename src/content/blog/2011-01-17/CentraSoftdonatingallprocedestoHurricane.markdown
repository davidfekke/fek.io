Brian Simmons, the president of [CentraSoft](http://www.centrasoft.com/), the makers of the CFMX Exam Buster, is donating all of CentraSoft's proceeds to help the victims of hurricane Katrina. Here are the details:

CentraSoft is donating all proceeds from the sale of CFMX Exam Buster from 12:01am Friday September 2nd, 2005 through 11:59pm Friday September 9th, 2005 to the American Red Cross (for Hurricane Katrina victims). That's right, you can purchase CFMX Exam Buster to help you study for the Macromedia ColdFusion MX 7.0 certification exam, and know that your purchase is being donated to a fantastic charity and helping people that are in dire need. 

100% of the proceeds from sales during the above mentioned time period will be donated to the American Red Cross. After September 9th, He will post the amount which has been donated to help the Hurricane Katrina victims. 

I know a lot of people are studying to take the CFMX 7 test. This would be a great oppurtunity to prepare for the test, and help those in need.
