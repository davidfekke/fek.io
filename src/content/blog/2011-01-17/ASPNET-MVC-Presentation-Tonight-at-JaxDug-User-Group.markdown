I am giving a presentation tonight on the ASP.NET MVC web application framework at the [Jaxdug](http://www.jaxdug.com). If you have not come out to a Jaxdug meeting before, you should. They do a good job of covering new development technology.

I will post the slides up on this website tonight after the presentation.
