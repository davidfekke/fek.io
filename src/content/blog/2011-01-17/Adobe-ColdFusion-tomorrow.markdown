Tomorrow marks the end of an era, and the beginning of a new one. Adobe and Macromedia officially merge tomorrow. As a ColdFusion developer, this will be my second one.

I remember different developers I knew freaking out about Macromedia buying Allaire. In the end, ColdFusion propably would not have survived if Macromedia had not bought Allaire. There have been three whole versions released since that merger.

I look forward to see what Adobe does with Macromedia's server products.
