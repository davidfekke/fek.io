We are happy to announce the newest version of iDogYears. This is a simple program that converts dog years into human years. It uses the canines actual weight plus the actual age to determine the age. You can install this app by going to this [link](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=377664932&mt=8) at the iTunes App store.
