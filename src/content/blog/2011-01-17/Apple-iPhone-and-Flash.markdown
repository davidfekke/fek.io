With Apple's announcements yesterday of the new iPhone, I did not hear anything about Flash. Mr. Jobs did say that the iPhone uses a version of Mac OS X. I do not know how similar this is to the desktop version of Mac OS X, but I am curious if it will use Flash or Flash Lite.

I have been building some Flex based applications lately, and it would be nice if there was a way to run these applications on the iPhone.
