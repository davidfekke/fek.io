I just added two new powerpoint presentations to my main site. I try to make it a habit of posting the powerpoint presentations I use at the JaxFusion User Group right after the meetings, but I have been lazy.

Over the last two months I did a presentation on Flex 2 and the Spry framework. These and my other presentations can be found [here](../http://www.fekke.com/?fuseaction=home.presentations) on my site.
