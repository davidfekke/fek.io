I have been getting a lot of questions about which libraries need to be installed in order for the Stax [sample code](http://www.fekke.com/XMLandStAXExamples.zip) to work. All of the Stax libraries are available from the [Codehaus.org](http://woodstox.codehaus.org/Download) site.

Here is a list of the Jar files I have installed in my web-inf/lib directory;

<div class="code">jsr173_1.0_api.jar  

jsr173_1.0_examples.jar  

jsr173_1.0_javadoc.jar  

jsr173_1.0_ri.jar  

jsr173_1.0_src.jar  

wstx-asl-3.0.1.jar  

stax2.jar

</div>
