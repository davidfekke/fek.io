I attended the [Tampa Code Camp](http://www.tampacodecamp.com/) on Saturday. If you have an opportunity to go to one of these conferences in the area you live, you should.

Microsoft used to host the Tampa Code Camp, but now the code camp is run by Visual Gov. These conferences are essentially one day conferences that are free for developers. 

The Tampa Code Camp had sessions on SQL Server, which were the sessions I attended, but also on AJAX, .NET, Silverlight, Sharepoint, XNA Gaming and a session on a Robotic API. 

Check and see if if there is one in your area.
