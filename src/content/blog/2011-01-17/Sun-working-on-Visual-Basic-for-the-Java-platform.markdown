I listen to the [Java Posse](http://www.javaposse.com/) each week, and one of their hosts works at Sun Microsystems. Tor Norbye gave a presentation at JavaOne on something Sun has under wraps for a while, [Visual Basic for the Java Platform](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/tor?entry=project_semplice_visual_basic_for).

I have never been a big fan of VB, but I know a lot of VB developers who felt they were left high and dry by Microsoft moving to .NET with all of the changes they made to make VB object oriented.

VB for the Java platform is taking advantage of the multi-language features in Mustang, the next major release of Java. As most ColdFusion developers know, you can run multiple different programming languages on Java already.
