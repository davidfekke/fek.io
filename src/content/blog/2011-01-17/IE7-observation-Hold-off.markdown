I upgraded my PC to IE7 today. One of the sites I like going to is [Digg.com](http://www.digg.com). It seems to take a really long time to display this site, and sometimes it fails to display the site with the CSS. I guess I will continue using Firefox as my primary browser for my PC for the time being.
