I remember when Mitch Williams blew the 93' World Series for the Phillies. This occured 5 years before the 'Devil Rays' threw there first Pitch.

I was at the Rays game 2 of the 98 season when the Rays had their first win. They did not have many more wins for the next nine years.

I am just happy that the Rays made it as far as they did this season. Conratulations to both teams.
