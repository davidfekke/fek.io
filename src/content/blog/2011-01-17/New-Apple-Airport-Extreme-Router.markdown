I purchased one of the new Apple Airport Extreme wireless routers this weekend. I have been using one of the older D-Link routers that is a 802.11G router. The D-Link has worked alright, but I would have problems with losing my connections. A couple of years ago I purchased an Apple Airport Express router as a backup when I traveled, and it worked better than my regular wireless router. This new extreme router has a USB port so I can connect external hard drives and printers. It also has three Ethernet ports for any computers that do not have wireless cards.

It is also is based on the new 802.11N standard. I am planning on upgrading my home to 802.11N, so this is the first step.
