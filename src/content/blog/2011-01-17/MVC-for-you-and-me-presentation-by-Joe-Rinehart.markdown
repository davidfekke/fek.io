I have never seen Joe Rinehart speak before, so I was curious to see his MVC presentation.

Some of his points from his presentation were that MVC is actually multiple design patterns, not just one. It combines three patterns, the Observer, Strategy and Compsite patterns.

The Strategy pattern allows developers to loosely couple their applications. The Observer pattern acts like a listener. The Composition pattern refers to a has-a pattern where an object can be built with smaller objects. The controller works as the observer pattern.

He then went into his Unity presentation. He did a demonstration with Reactor. Reactor uses the scaffold tag.
