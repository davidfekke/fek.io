I will be giving a presentation at May's [JAXDUG](http://www.jaxdug.com/) meeting on the [ASP .NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/) framework. The MVC framework is modern web application framework for .NET that shares many popular features with other popular frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, DJango, Grails and ColdBox.
