CNBC must have good sources because they are reporting that Apple is coming out with an iPhone next year. They are also reporting that Apple has another iPhone in the works that will come out the first generation phone.

Once again, I am screwed because I just bought a new phone. It is an LG CU500\. The coolest thing about it is that it supports 3G networks. According to my provider, it offers faster internet access than the wireless PC card they provide.

I think I will wait to get an iPhone until after the second generation phone comes out.
