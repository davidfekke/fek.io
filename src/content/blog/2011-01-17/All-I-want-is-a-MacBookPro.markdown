Apple showed off a new laptop today called the [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/). All I can say is I want one. It is four times faster than the current PowerBook, and features a dual core intel processor.

It will not ship for another six to eight weeks, but Apple is taking orders today. I wish Apple had done this two years ago when I bought my last laptop.
