I am a huge sports fan. I wanted to say that before anyone got the wrong idea. I used to play Soccer, or Association Football as my brother-in-law likes to call it, when I was kid and later as an adult. My brother-in-law played professionally in the U.K. I also have played baseball, basketball and I currently crew competitively.

Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, or so I have been told. If this is true, I really feel sorry for the world. The last two world cup finals I have watched have been decided by kickoff competition.

One of the things I like about baseball is that there is no tying, or crying for that matter. Both teams play until someone wins. A baseball game usually lasts for nine innings, but it may go 14 or 15 innings before a winner is decided.

I think FIFA should change the rules, especially for the final rounds, so that Both teams play until someone scores a goal.

Another change that should be adopted is the idea of a penalty box like in Hockey. That way if your captain headbuts another player, instead of getting a red card, he could sit out ten minutes in the box.

There are also a lot of dramatics on the field with players falling down like they are hurt, especially when the other team is trying to score a goal. I heard on the news that the doctors for the world cup said that half of the players who do this have no injury at all. They should not stop play if a player falls down.

I think FIFA should adopt these changes if they want to remain the "most popular sport in the world".
