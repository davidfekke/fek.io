From Greg Wilson, Adobe Evangelist:

Speakers:

I am happy to announce that Ben Forta, Director of Platform

Evangelism (and my boss!) will be speaking at this event. Anyone

that has traveled with Ben quickly discovers that he is practically a

celebrity, especially in the ColdFusion world... so... we've also invited

the local Tampa ColdFusion User Group to join us!

Also joining us will be Kevin Hoyt, Adobe technical evangelist

extraordinaire. Kevin is a very frequent speaker on multiple topics

including AJAX, Flex, AIR and many other topics. You're guaranteed

to see something cool from Kevin.

Between the three of us, we plan to cover a lot of topics, including

the following:

Flash 10 - what's new, what's cool

ColdFusion Future Sneak Peek

Flex 3.2

Flex 4 preview

Catalyst (formerly Thermo) preview

AIR 1.5

Connecting your Flex/AIR applications to the backend

LiveCycle Data Services

BlazeDS

BlazeDS and Spring Integration

Much much more

We plan to start promptly at 6pm, so be there! There is no cost to

attend, but an RSVP is requested to rsvp@tffadg.com. For more

information, please visit www.tffadg.com.
