The next Jaxfusion user group meeting will be hosted by me and I will be covering XML features in ColdFusion, and features that have been added since 7\. This presentation will also cover how to leverage Java to overcome the shortcomings of XML DOM. The meeting will be held at Vurv Technology in Jacksonville, FL on October third at 6:30 PM.
