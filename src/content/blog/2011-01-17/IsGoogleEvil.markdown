Google's moto is 'Do no Evil'. I was reading an [article](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/n/a/2005/08/08/financial/f134424D42.DTL&type=printable) today in the San Francisco Gate about how Google employee's are banned from talking to News.com reporters for a year.

I am not a big fan of the term 'Evil Corporation', but I think that Google does some things that can be considered unethical. The News.com piece showed how you can look up personal information using Google. For the example in the article, they used Google's CEO. I guess he did not like his just desert.

As you have propably noticed I run Google ads on my web site. Just so people do not think I am trying to bite the hand that feeds me, Google does a lot of things I like. I use their Search engine everyday. I also use some of their APIs as well. On that note, I think Eric E. Schmidt is great guy!
