I have not seen a lot of discussion on open source projects that move to commercial products. I have noticed a couple of open source projects lately that have been abandoned, and the authors have since released commercial versions of the same project. I am guessing the reasoning is that they could actually sell the applications, and make money with the project. I am not a legal expert, but this seems to be a violation of the GPL.

One of the problems I see with open source is that if someone does violate the GPL, there is no real way to enforce this. Who is going to sue?
