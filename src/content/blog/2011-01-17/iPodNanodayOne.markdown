Well I bought one. I got an [iPod Nano](http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/) today. I have always been a fan of Apple's hardware, and this is the third one I have owned.

A couple of things blew me away about this iPod. It has flash based memory, so it has much longer battery life. It also has a color screen, and synced all of my photos the first time I plugged it in.
