I just got back from California last week where I was receiving training at the Adobe campus on Flex 2\. I am by no means an expert yet, but I figured this would be a good opportunity to present on how to build a simple app in Flex 2\. This presentation will also give an overview of MXML and ActionScript 3.

The [JaxFusion](http://www.jaxfusion.org) User group meets the first Tuesday of the month at Vurv Technology in Jacksonville. The meetings start at 6:30 PM.
