I have received numerous emails from people today about my comments popup not working correctly. I am still researching this problem. Some people seem to be able to post, and others do not. It may be related to a DNS issue. The IP address for my site is ??.??.?.??. This was a recent change in the last month, and for some reason it has not propegated to all DNS servers.
