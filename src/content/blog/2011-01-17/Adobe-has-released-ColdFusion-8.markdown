It is official. Adobe has shipped [ColdFusion 8](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/). I am really exciting about this release. The next JaxFusion meeting will be going over some of the new features in ColdFusion 8.

I am still trying to secure a room for the next JaxFusion meeting. I hope to have another update shortly this week.
