I just picked up my new MacBook Pro this morning. This is my first Mac based laptop, even though I have owned and worked with Macs since the 1980's. This is also my first Intel based Mac, so I look forward to start playing with the multiple operating system support.

I purchased Flex builder earlier this year, and I plan on moving that over from my desktop to my MacBook. I plan on installing ColdFusion and MySQL on it as well.
