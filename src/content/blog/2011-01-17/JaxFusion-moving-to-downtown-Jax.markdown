The JaxFusion user group will be moving to downtown Jacksonville. I do not have the next meeting scheduled yet, but the meetings will be held at the Modis building in downtown Jacksonville. The meetings have been held at Vurv in the Deerwood parkway area, but we have decided to move to a more central location.

I want to thank Vurv for letting me have the meetings there for the last two years. I will have more details on the new location on the [JaxFusion](http://www.jaxfusion.org/) website soon.
