Adobe is making the rounds of different user groups presenting the next version of ColdFusion. The next version of ColdFusion, codenamed 'Scorpio', should be released sometime this year.

Adam Lehman from Adobe will be presenting on this version of ColdFusion at the next JaxFusion user group on April 23rd at 6:30 PM. I have not had a chance to update the JaxFusion web site, but I should have more information about this meeting shortly.
