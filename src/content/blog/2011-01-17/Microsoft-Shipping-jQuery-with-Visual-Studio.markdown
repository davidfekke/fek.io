jQuery has been popular in the ColdFusion community, but it is also popular in the .NET community. It is popular enough that Microsoft is including the jQuery library with Visual Studio going forward.

Microsoft already includes AJAX .NET libraries with Visual Studio 2008 as part of the IDE. The 15k jQuery library will be included now as well. jQuery is an open source library, so it is nice to see Microsoft carrying an open source library with one of their products.

Scott Guthrie has a [blog entry](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx) about this along with some jQuery examples.

I am thinking about having a presentation on jQuery at the next JaxFusion meeting in October.
