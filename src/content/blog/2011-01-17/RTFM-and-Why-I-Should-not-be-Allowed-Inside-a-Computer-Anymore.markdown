title: "RTFM and Why I Should not be Allowed Inside a Computer Anymore"

I recently purchased Adobe Creative Suite 3 for my Mac G5 tower. When I bought the suite I did not realize that it required a minimum of 1 Gigabyte of RAM to install. I only had 512 MB that came with the Mac when I bought it, so I decided to buy some more RAM.

This is where my nightmare started. When I came home with my i Gig RAM stick, I installed it, and turned my computer on to find out that it did see the stick of RAM. 

Then I seated the stick in all the way, restarted the computer, and the computer flashed the status light twice.

This is when I decided to break out the manual. I have a T-shirt that says 'RTFM', but I did not follow my own ethos.

The manual for the G5 says that two flashes means that it can not see the RAM in the computer. It also says that the RAM sticks have to be in opposing RAM bays. 

Since I only had one stick, I had to go back to the Computer store and buy a second stick that was identical to the one I purchased. This is when the computer store guy says to me, "oh, you have a dual processor machine."

So I put the other RAM stick in the opposing RAM bay, and the computer started up without a problem. This is why I should not be allowed back in a computer for the foreseeable future.
