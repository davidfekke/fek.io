The next JaxFusion [meeting](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1+W+Independent+Dr,+Jacksonville,+Duval,+Florida+32202,+United+States&sll=30.32422,-81.65848&sspn=1.164049,1.851196&ie=UTF8&cd=2&om=1&ll=30.326175,-81.658287&spn=0.008557,0.014462&z=16&iwloc=addr) has been announced. The meeting will be held at the new location at the Modis building in downtown Jacksonville.

The topic this time will be covering integrating .NET with ColdFusion. There are a lot of new features coming in ColdFusion 8, but it is possible to integrate older versions of ColdFusion and .NET. The presentation will cover the differences between the different versions of ColdFusion and BlueDragon.NET.

If you live in the Jacksonville area, come on out.
