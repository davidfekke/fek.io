I just learned that a good friend of mine, Darren Bunn, has passed away.

It has been a reminder to me about how precious life is and how important it is to live life to its fullest. I believe Darren was only about 36 or 37 years old. 

He will be deeply missed by his friends and family.

Update:

There is an [Obit](http://bcmacdill.createatribute.com/registryMain.php?i_memorialid=1204897240) now on the Blount & Curry web site.
