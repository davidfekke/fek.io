I have been trying to find a Podcasts on ColdFusion, and I just found out about one called the [ColdFusion Podcast](http://www.coldfusionpodcast.com/) by Bryan Kaiser and Michael Haynie. These guys do a great job covering the latest news, blogs and theory surrounding ColdFusion. This is a definite must listen if you listen to Podcasts.
