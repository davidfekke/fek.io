Ok, I am on the bandwagon now. I just started a [twitter](http://www.twitter.com) account. I have also added a twitter widget to my blog.

The widget I added to my blog is a Flash widget. Twitter also has HTML Javascript widgets that can be added to your homepage. The best feature I like about twitter is the ability to update my accout over my cell phone using SMS messages.
