Topic: SQL Server 2008 T-SQL Enhancements

This intermediate session by Plamen Ratchev, will focus on some of the T-SQL enhancements in SQL Server 2008 like the new MERGE functionality. These enhancements can cut your coding significantly and can run much faster than SQL Server 2005\. Those that came to Plamen's last session requested to see him again.
