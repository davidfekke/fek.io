I read about [this](http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/3/20/Flex-Data-Services-Update-On-Labs) on Ben Forta's [blog](http://www.forta.com/blog/). Adobe is renaming Flex Data Services to [LiveCycle Data Services](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/livecycle_dataservices2_5/). Data Services is an important part of the Flex/Apollo products because of the ability Data Services gives you to push data to the client using modern messaging.

Adobe is currently looking for feedback from developers. Data Services runs as a J2EE app.
