This year I decided to run in the Gate River Run here in Jacksonville. The race is a 15k (9.4 miles) race with some 11000 runners. I have never run a race like this before, but I would up [finishing](http://www.jacksonville.com/splrunning/search_2007.shtml?RecordID=6421&PageID=3&PrevPageID=2&cpipage=1&CPIsortType=&CPIorderBy=) in 1:36\. I was pretty happy with my 11 minute mile, but I saw that some of the runners averaged 4 minute miles. Frankly, I was just happy to finish.
