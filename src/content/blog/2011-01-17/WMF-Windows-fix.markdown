Many of you have probably heard about the WMF exploit that Microsoft still does not have a fix for yet. Steve Gibson over at GRC is hosting a fix and a vulnerablity checker on his [web site](http://www.GRC.com/).

The [fix](http://www.GRC.com/miscfiles/wmffix_hexblog14.exe) and the [vulnerability checker](http://www.GRC.com/miscfiles/wmf_checker_hexblog.exe) were developed by Ilfak Guilfanov and tested by Steve Gibson.

I consider Steve Gibson the best resource on Computer Security. He hosts a podcast with Leo Leporte called [Security Now](http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm) that is a must listen.
