Charlie Arehart suggested to me over a year ago that I put a sound up on my web site so people can hear how my last name "Fekke" is pronounced.

I decided to create a small Flex application to play back the audio of how to pronounce my last name. Here is the [link](http://www.fekke.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.pronounceMyName) to the page on my web site where I keep the audio of my last name. This is actually the first Flex application I have put on my web site. I hope to put more up there soon.
