I live in Jacksonville, and AOL has a large Call Center down the street from my home. Well AOL lost 875,000 subscribers last quarter, so they are closing that call center. I was once an AOL user back in the day, but I got an actual internet ISP account in 1994\. So I have not used AOL in 12 years. I remember when they were a Mac only service as well.

I certainly feel bad for the employees who lost their jobs today, but I think the writting has been on the wall for AOL for a long time.

They had an extremely nice facilty here in Jax. AOL is having Job fairs to try to place the 1200 workers who lost their jobs today.
