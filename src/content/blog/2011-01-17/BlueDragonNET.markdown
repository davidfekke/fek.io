I have recently started evaluating BlueDragon.NET from [New Atlanta](http://www.newatlanta.com). I heard that MySpaces will be switching to BlueDragon.NET soon, and I was curious to see if I can leverage .NET and ADO.NET with my CFML code.

My first impressions so far have been mixed. I have used the Java version of BlueDragon before, but this is my first attempt with the .NET version. Before you can install, please use this check list to make sure you have the following running on your development box;

*   A PC with Windows 2000 or XP Pro

*   IIS installed and running

*   .NET installed, either 1.1 or 2.0

*   The ASP.NET configured to run with IIS

*   The J# language pack addon for .NET

*   The BlueDragon.NET installer

If you need to run Multiple versions of ColdFusion, then I would suggest reading Charlie Arehart has written an article in the CFDJ on how to run multiple versions of CF and BD on the same box. New Atlanta has a copy of the article on their [website](http://www.newatlanta.com/images/CFDJ_03_09_Blueprints.pdf).
