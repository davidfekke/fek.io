The Florida Times-Union has a nice [article](http://jacksonville.com/news/metro/2010-05-09/story/unf-creates-gaming-and-mobile-app-program-meet-booming-student-demand) on a Game and Mobile development program at the University of North Florida. The article talks about a game that a friend of mine is developing called "[Ascension War: Triumvirate](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=2&ved=0CBwQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ascensionwar.com%2F2010%2F02%2Fwelcome-to-the-official-ascension-war-triumvirate-website%2F&ei=CSHoS6GTO47glQeeh_3wAw&usg=AFQjCNF26Q6VsDdhWuxDeU3qIS3tttjQcQ&sig2=5vZFZNZBlCWOr4mWa6mM2A)".

I am glad to see that UNF and other colleges are focusing on mobile applications. If you look at the number of people around the world who have mobile phones vs. a personal computers, many more have mobile phones. The future of client app development will be on mobile phones.
