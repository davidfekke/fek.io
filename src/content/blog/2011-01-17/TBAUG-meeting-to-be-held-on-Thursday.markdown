The inaugural meeting of the newly reformed Tampa Bay Adobe User Group (TBAUG) will be held this week at the International Academy of Design and Technology. The meeting time is on Thursday, November 17th at 6:30pm.

My former boss and good friend, Donald Bickel, is heading up this new group. If you live in the Tampa Bay area, please come out and help him get the group started with a bang. The evening will include a presentation of Macromedia's latest product offerings, along with a Macromedia prize raffle. Refreshments will be served.
