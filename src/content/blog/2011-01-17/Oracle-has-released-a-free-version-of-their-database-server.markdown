Oracle has released a free version of their database server software. It is called [Oracle Express](http://www.oracle.com/corporate/press/2005_oct/103105_databasexe_finalsite.html). It looks like a competitor to the SQL Server express and MySQL products.

It will work with Redhat and Windows. No Mac installer yet.
