I ordered the Apollo Flex Developers pocket guide from O'Reilly books when I read about it on Mike Chambers' blog. It finally arrived yesterday in my Mailbox.

I have not had a chance to read the whole yet, but it is a pocket guide, so it should not take long to read. Thanks to Mike Chambers, Robert Dixon and Jeff Swartz for writing the book.
