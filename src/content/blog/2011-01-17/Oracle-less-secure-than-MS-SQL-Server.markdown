I saw this [story](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9005383&source=rss_topic17) over on DIGG today. There was a study done that shows that Oracle's database has more security flaws then SQL Server.

I will point out that I am biased. I have used both SQL Server and Oracle, and I prefer MS SQL Server. I have found it much easier to develop on SQL Server because of the client and integration tools. 

The article also points out that there are many zero day exploits that Oracle has not fixed.
