As many of you have been reading, Macromedia released an update to ColdFusion MX 7\. You can download the updater for version 7.0.1 from macromedia's [website](http://www.macromedia.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html#mx7). What got me exited was Macromedia finally has a Mac OS X installer for ColdFusion MX 7.0.1\.
