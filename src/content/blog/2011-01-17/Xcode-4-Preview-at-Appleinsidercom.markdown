Apple Insider has a nice [preview](http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/06/19/inside_apples_new_xcode_4_development_tool.html "Xcode 4") of the next version of Apple's Xcode IDE. Xcode 4 was previewed at WWDC, Apple's developer conference earlier this month. I have been developing applications in Xcode for a little over year, and it looks like it fixes a lot of the complaints that I and other developers have had about xcode 3 who have used Visual Studio.

One of the biggest changes is that Interface Builder is no longer a separate application, it is built into Xcode. Another one of that changes is that there is a single window for the whole IDE. You can open up your header file and implementation file at the same time.

I know this will make the Ruby developers happy, Xcode 4 supports git. Apple is also adding a timeline viewer so you can use a time machine like slider to look at you code changes as well as side by side comparisons of the different versions of the file.

I am very excited about this release of Xcode.
