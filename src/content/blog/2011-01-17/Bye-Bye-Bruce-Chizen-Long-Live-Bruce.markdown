I just read on Ryan Stewarts blog that Adobe's CEO Bruce Chizen is stepping down as CEO. I always liked the cut of Bruce's jib.

I think his tenure will be most remembered for the merger between Adobe and Macromedia. I think the merger was a win win for developers and Adobe and Macromedia. Bruce also managed not to be kidnaped while CEO.
