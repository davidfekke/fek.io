Ben Forta has a [post](http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/1/22/Anyone-Want-To-Beta-Test-Scorpio) on his blog asking for anyone interested in [beta testing](https://prerelease.adobe.com/callout/apply.html?callid={E9F64ADB-DADA-485E-BFFE-60E0D783EBEF}) ColdFusion 8.

I participated in the ColdFusion 7 beta. It is a great opportunity to look at the new features and help find bugs before the product is released to the masses. I highly recommend becoming a ColdFusion beta tester.
