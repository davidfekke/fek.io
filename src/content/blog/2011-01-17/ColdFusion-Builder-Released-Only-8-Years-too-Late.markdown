Adobe released [ColdFusion Builder](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/buy/#cfb "ColdFusion Builder 1.0") 1.0 today. This is the first ColdFusion IDE since ColdFusion Studio back in the 90's.

This new IDE will cost $299.00, and includes the Flash Builder 4\. You will be able to build Air apps with this IDE as well.

ColdFusion Builder is based on the Eclipse IDE, which has already been popular as a Java and ColdFusion editor already. You can install CF Builder as a stand alone IDE, or as a plugin to an existing version of Eclipse.
