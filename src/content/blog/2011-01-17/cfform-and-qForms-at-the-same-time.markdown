Just finished watching a presentation on cfform by Mike Nimer of Macromedia. He showed how you can create you own XML skins for forms using CFML.

One of the examples he gave used the fckeditor. He also said that you can use qForms in your skin if you do not like the JavaScript generated with cfform. I am a huge fan of qForms, so I will probably start creating my own skins now to take advantage of this feature.
