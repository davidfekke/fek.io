Adobe has put a pre-release version of Apollo on [Adobe Labs](http://labs.adobe.com). The [Labs page](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/apollo/) for the pre-release has links for the runtime and the Apollo SDK. Apollo is the codename for Adobe's new cross platform runtime that lets developers use web technologies (i.e. html, Flash, Flex) to build cross platform desktop applications.

I hope to put some sample apps that I have been working on up on my site soon.
