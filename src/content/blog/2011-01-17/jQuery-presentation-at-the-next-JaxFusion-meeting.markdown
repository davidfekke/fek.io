jQuery will be the focus of the next JaxFusion meeting this coming Tuesday. jQuery has been popular with the ColdFusion community for awhile, but Microsoft will be including it with their ASP.NET products going forward.

There are millions of javascript frameworks for developers to use, but there is a lot of momentum behind jQuery. I am using it with my current job, and have found it to be very powerful.

The next [JaxFusion meeting](http://www.jaxfusion.org/meeting.cfm) will be on October 21st at 6:30 PM at Southwest Signal.
