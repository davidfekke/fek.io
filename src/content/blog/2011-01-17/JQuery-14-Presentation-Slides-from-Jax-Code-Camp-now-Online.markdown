Thanks to everyone who came out to Jax Code Camp this last Saturday. Attendees from my presentation on jQuery and .NET asked if I would post my slides and code on this website. The slides can be downloaded from [this link](http://www.fekke.com/Content/jQuery%20Presentation.ppt "jQuery Presentation"). I have also posted a copy of the [example code](http://www.fekke.com/blog/JQueryTest.zip "JQuery Sample Code") I used during my presentation. I also used Phil Haack's [example](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/04/14/using-jquery-grid-with-asp.net-mvc.aspx "jquery grid example") of using jqGrid and MVC together.
