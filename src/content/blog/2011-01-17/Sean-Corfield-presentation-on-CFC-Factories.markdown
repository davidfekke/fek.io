Sean gave the first presentation I went too on creating factories for CFC based objects. As always, Sean is a great presenter and covered the topic well. He ended the presentation with a discussion of the ColdSpring framework.

ColdSpring simplifies the creation of factories by using a configurable XML file. I am going to see another presentation while I am here at CFUNITED on ColdSpring.
