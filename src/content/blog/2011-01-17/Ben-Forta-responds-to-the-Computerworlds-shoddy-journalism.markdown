Ben Forta has responded to the Mary Brandel piece on ColdFusion being dead.

In his [response](http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/5/25/Todays-Irresponsible-Journalism-Award-Goes-To-Mary-Brandel)<a>, he mentions that Computerworld has refused to hear from Adobe or listen to their side. All in all, sounds like Shoddy journalism from Computerworld. </a>
