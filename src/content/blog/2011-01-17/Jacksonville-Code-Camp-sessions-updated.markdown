The Jacksonville Code Camp [website](http://jaxcodecamp.com) has updated the [Sessions](http://jaxcodecamp.com/Sessions.aspx) that will be available. If you have not registered to attend, go ahead and do so before the event fills up.

Also, if you would like to see more Flex/Air/ColdFusion presentations, let the organizers know. The Code Camp will be held August 23rd, and it is free to anyone.
