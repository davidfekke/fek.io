Last week I posted qustion if anyone knows what K.I.S.S. stood for? This weeks question is what does R.T.F.M. stand for? R.T.F.M. stands for Read the *%$#@& manual. I forgot what the middle word was, but please do post any profanity to my comments section.

I have a project that I have been working on that provides a standard interface into one of my companies applications. We created a document that provides information about the methods and parameters that are exposed through our SOAP web services.

For the last month I have been answering questions that could be found in our API document. I hope I do not seem anti-social, but I am spending half of my week answering questions that could be answered by reading the manual.

Yesterday I wrote an example of how our software could be used by writing an example in C#. I am not paid or trained to write C#, but I found myself doing it to show the developers how to do it.

R.T.F.M. Please!
