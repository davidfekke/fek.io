The Jacksonville [Code Camp site](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com/Home.aspx "Jacksonville Code Camp 2011") for 2011 is now open for registration. The Code Camp is a free software conference on the last Saturday of August every year. I will be presenting this year in the web track. I hope to see you all there again.

Here is the writeup from the home page;
