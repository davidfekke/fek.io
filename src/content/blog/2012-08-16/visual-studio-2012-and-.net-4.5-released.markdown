Microsoft has released new versions of Visual Studio and .NET 4.5\. There are a lot of cool new features like better HTML and CSS editors. The Javascript editor now has full intellisence support.

Scott Hanselman has a [great post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualStudio2012AndNETFramework45IsRELEASEDHeres5MinuteVideosToGetYouUpToSpeedQuick.asp "VS2012 and .NET 4.5") on the new features, plus videos on some of those new features. The videos average about 6 minutes in length, and give a great overview of those features.

Microsoft also released a new version of ASP.NET MVC, MVC4\. This version has the new Web API and mobile features. Scott shows these features on his post as well.
