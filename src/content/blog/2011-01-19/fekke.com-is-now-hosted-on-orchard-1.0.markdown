I moved my site over to [Orchard](http://www.orchardproject.net "Orchard") 1.0 today. If you are not familiar with Orchard, it is a new open source content management system based on ASP.NET MVC 3.0.

I used Nick Mayne's BlogML importer to bring over my old blog. I will have a post up soon on the <span class="spell noline">challenges</span> I had with my conversion.

Here is the writeup on The Orchard web site about their mission;

Orchard is a **free, open source, community-focused** project aimed at delivering applications and reusable components on the ASP.NET platform.

Orchard will create shared components for building ASP.NET applications and extensions, and specific applications that leverage these components to meet the needs of end-users, designers, developers, and Web professionals. Additionally, we seek to create partnerships with existing application authors to help them achieve their goals. Orchard is delivered as part of the [ASP.NET Open Source Gallery](http://www.outercurve.org/Galleries/ASPNETOpenSourceGallery.aspx) under the [Outercurve Foundation](http://www.outercurve.org/). It is licensed under a [New BSD license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php), which is approved by the OSI.

The intended output of the Orchard project is three-fold:

*   Individual .NET-based applications that appeal to end-users, designers, developers, and Web professionals
*   A set of re-usable components that makes it easy to build such applications
*   A vibrant community to help define these applications and extensions

In the near term, the Orchard project is focused on delivering a .NET-based CMS application that will allow users to rapidly create content-driven Websites, and an extensibility framework that will allow developers and customizers to provide additional functionality through module extensions and themes.
