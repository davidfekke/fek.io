I have not had a Privacy Policy on my web site until today. I recently decided to turn on web logging for my web site, and decided to add a privacy policy.

My privacy policy can be read at the [this url](http://www.fekke.com/terms). I am also using P3P on this site now as well. I encourage any web developers who are not familiar with [P3P](http://www.w3.org/P3P/) to read about it at the [W3C](http://www.w3c.org) site.
