# Restaurants you can fly to in Florida

## Airport Tiki (B, L, D)
[KFPR](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KFPR) Treasure Coast International Airport 
This airport diner is perfect for those who have just cleared customs
coming back from the Bahamas and points south. While your airplane is
fueled you can grab a quick nosh before heading home.

## CJ Cannon’s (B, L, D)
[KVRB](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KVRB) Vero Beach Regional Airport
Thirty years of airport restaurant service with a smile. Come get your
dose of Southern comfort food in a unique retro decor.

## High Jackers (L, D)
[KFIN](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KFIN) Flagler Executive Airport
People love the peel-and-eat shrimp, and the massive build-your-own
burgers (watch the CG after eating this!). Not fancy but definitely
fun and filling.

## The Perfect Spot Airport Restaurant (B, L, D)
[KDED](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KDED) Deland Municipal-Sidney H. Taylor Field
You’ll be perfectly positioned to watch the skydivers landing after
each jump. Free parking east of Runway 5/23.

## Airport Restaurant and Gin Mill (B, L, D)
[KDED](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KDED) Deland Municipal-Sidney H. Taylor Field
Because sometimes one restaurant on the airfield simply isn’t enough.
It features an awesome porch.

## Flightline Café (B, L, D)
[KGIF](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KGIF) Winter Haven Regional Airport
Winter Haven is seaplane heaven, with plenty of hard surface for those
who don’t fly floats (but take a lesson while you are in town—it’s
fun!) Come to the Flightline Cafe for the pastrami sandwich or the
fried shrimp, and of course, the runway views. Definitely try the
fried green tomatoes (a southern classic).

## Pyper Kub Cafe and Restaurant (B, L)
[X60](https://www.airnav.com/airport/X60) Williston Municipal Airport
Great views of the runway and a funky décor, customers say. All that
and consistently inexpensive self-serve avgas.

## Runways at Bartow (B, L)
[KBOW](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KBOW) Bartow Municipal Airport
Stuffed french toast anyone? Huge omelets are on tap as well. This is
an easy-in, easy-out airport.

## Suncoast Café (B, L)
[KVNC](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KVNC) Venice Municipal Airport
Get the curry! The chef, Tony, is from the Caribbean, and his food
definitely reflects that. From crab-stuffed calamari to curried goat,
you won’t find more variety on an airport cafe menu. Excellent
omelets, pressed Cuban sandwiches, and crab cakes Benedict. Sign in at
the front desk and your handling fee is waived for the time you are at
the restaurant (not your entire week in Florida).

## Tailwind Café (B, L, D)
[KOCF](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KOCF) Ocala International-Jim Taylor Field
Another airport restaurant where the burger is the thing—just get it.
Breakfast menu is standard fare; why mess with simplicity? Rumor has
it that veterans get a 25-percent discount.

## The Hangar (B, L, D)
[KSPG](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KSPG) Albert Whitted Airport
Famous for its burgers and great breakfasts, stick around late and you
can catch First Monday Jazz with Al Downing Jazz. The airport is right
on Tampa Bay, giving you the opportunity to practice that “carrier”
approach. Airport and water views, plus good food? Divine.

## Runway Café (B, L)
[KSEF](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KSEF) Sebring Regional Airport
Tuck into classic breakfast fare and a shrimp po’boy at lunch that
patrons rave about. Another easy-in, easy-out airport, with the
benefit of Skip Barber racing within earshot.

## Landing Strip Café (B, L)
[KOBE](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KOBE) Okeechobee County Airport
This is a greasy spoon-style restaurant with a loyal patronage. One
caveat: It draws from both the east and west coasts of Florida, so get
there early on a weekend.

## Conch Flyer Restaurant (B, L, D)
[KEYW](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KEYW) Key West International Airport
If you are stuck hanging out at the Key West Airport, the Conch Flyer
will feed you the town’s signature fare with a view of the runway. It
is located right next to the fixed-base operator, in the commercial
terminal. That said, you’ll be rubbing shoulders with lots of airline
passengers (or jockeying for a table with them).

## Jet Runway Café (B, L)
[KFXE](https://www.airnav.com/airport/KFXE) Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport
How many airport restaurants are Zagat rated? If you’ve stopped in to
pick up or drop off your overwater safety gear (Banyan FBO rents it),
stay to eat and let your taste buds go wild with this restaurant's
creative American-style menu. The servings are generous, menu
selections are ample, and food is good.
