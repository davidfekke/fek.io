We will be releasing new versions of all of our applications for iOS 5 when it is released. All of our apps are being optimized so they will run natively on the iPad. 

Currently all of applications run on the iPad, but in iPhone mode. The new versions will be able to take full advantage of the screen size of the iPad.
