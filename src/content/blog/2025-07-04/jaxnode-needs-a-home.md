The JaxNode user group needs a new home. For most of the past 11 years we have been meeting at Availity. 
We are extremely grateful that Availity has been kind enough and has supported us and other user groups here in Jacksonville.
As with most things, everything must come to an end.

If you have a venue that you would be willing to offer for us to meet, we would be extremely grateful and help promote your company or organization as JaxNode sponsor. 
Helping user groups is a great way of extending good will through your local tech community.

The JaxNode user group usually meets once a month on a weekday evening. We do not meet during the months of November or December due to the holidays. We also need a way to connect to the internet for live demos.

If you would be interested in hosting, please send me a message through the [contact page](/contact) of this website.
