My current engagement has come to an end, and I am now available to work on new projects. I have spent the last seven and half years building native mobile applications, primarily for iOS devices, but also on Android.

At my last engagement I not only worked on a greenfield iOS application for a major Silicon Valley based fin-tech company, but I also built out the CI/CD systems we used to build, test and deploy our mobile apps. Part of this was moving our CI/CD process from a custom [Fastlane](https://fastlane.tools/) Gitlab solution to [Bitrise.io](https://bitrise.io).

## Whats next?

I have spent most of my career working on publicly facing web applications, mobile applications, and the back end systems that support those applications. I would like to continue to build this type of software, but with a new emphasis on AI. A lot of the attention this past year has been on the AI boom going on with companies like OpenAI, Microsoft and Google. Most of these companies allow developers to build applications on top of the AI models that they have already built. I have been building software that utilizes these AI services.

## Work location

I currently reside in Jacksonville, Fl, and I have been working remotely for the last two years. I am open to either working in an office, hybrid work or continuing to work remotely. I can also travel for work. Relocation is not impossible, but highly unlikely.

## About Me and My Experience
