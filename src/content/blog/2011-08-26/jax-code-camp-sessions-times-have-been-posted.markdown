The session times for tomorrow's Jacksonville Code Camp have been [posted](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com/Agenda.aspx/Sessions "Sessions"). It is still not too late to [register](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com/Attendee.aspx/Register "Register") for Jacksonville's 7th annual Code Camp. 

A code camp is essentially a day of free software development training. I have been going to and presenting at the Jacksonville Code Camp for the last six years.

I am giving a presentation on ASP.NET MVC 3 and code first database prototyping. My presentation is also going to touch on the next version of MVC, and how you can start using those features today.

I look forward to seeing you there tomorrow.
