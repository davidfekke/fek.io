I am going to be giving a presentation on Wednesday on using JQuery with ASP.NET MVC 3 at the JaxDUG. JaxDUG is moving their meeting space to a different building on the LPS campus. The meetings will now be held at the Penn building in the auditorium.

The meeting starts at 6:00 PM this Wednesday, March 7th.

I am going to covering four areas in this presentation. Those areas are as follows;

1.  Validation
2.  Interactivity
3.  AJAX
4.  Widgets and UI

<div>I am going to have lots of examples on how to use JQuery with ASP.NET MVC3\. The MVC Framework was designed with JQuery in mind. Microsoft has taken full advantage of the JQuery framework in MVC, and they are actively making additions to JQuery as part of their open source initiatives.</div><div>I will post my slides after the presentation on Wednesday. I look forward to seeing you there at the meeting.</div>
