Phil Japikse will be giving a presentation tonight at the [JAXDUG](http://www.jaxdug.com) meeting at the LPS campus at 6:00 PM tonight. Here is the writeup from the [JAXDUG](http://www.jaxdug.com) site;

## Implementing M-V-VM (Model-View-View Model) for WPF

Now you are writing WPF applications, and wondering – what is all this code in the code behind? Shouldn’t we be doing something different? Our cousins working with ASP.NET MVC don’t even have a code behind! The answer is YES – you should indeed be doing it differently. The M-V-VM pattern is the WPF adaptation of the Presentation Model pattern (first documented by Martin Fowler). I will show how the M-V-VM pattern is utilized for building SOLID WPF applications that are also testable.
