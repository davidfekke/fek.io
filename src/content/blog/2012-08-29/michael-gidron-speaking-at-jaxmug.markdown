Michael Gidron will be speaking tomorrow on developing for Android at the JaxMUG meeting. This is part of a series of presentations on going from zero experience to getting your applications onto the app store for that platform. Michael is a former colleague of mine from LPS, and a great engineer. Michael has been developing for mobile since the Palm, and has great insight into developing for mobile platforms.

Android has an interesting SDK. You can build apps for android using the Java language. I am certain Michael will go into detail on the developer experience using the Android SDK.

The [JaxMUG](http://jaxmug.com/) meets the forth thursday each month. We are currently meeting at the Jacksonville [Southside public library](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=10599+Deerwood+Park+Blvd+Jacksonville+FL+32256&iwloc=A&hl=en). The meeting will start tomorrow at 6:00 PM. I look forward to seeing everyone there tomorrow.
