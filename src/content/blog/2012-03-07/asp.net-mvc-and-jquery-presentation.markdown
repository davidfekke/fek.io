I wanted to thank everyone for coming out tonight and supporting the JaxDUG group. I just posted my presentation on using ASP.NET MVC with JQuery 1.7.1\. All of my powerpoint presentations are up on this site at the [fekke.com/powerpoint](http://www.fekke.com/powerpoint "Powerpoint"). The presentation I did tonight can be found at the following [link](http://www.fekke.com/media/default/powerpoint/ASPNETMVC3JQuery.pptx "ASP.NET MVC 3 JQuery").

I plan on publishing the source code up in segments when I get the time. Please let me know what you thought of the presentation if you attended tonight.
