It is only five days until this years Jacksonville Code Camp. I am going to be giving a presentation on Objective-C for C# and Java developers.

If you have not signed up yet for the Jacksonville Code Camp, it is not too late to sign up. The registration for code camp can be filled out at [eventbrite](http://jaxcodecamp2012.eventbrite.com/ "Code Camp Registration").
