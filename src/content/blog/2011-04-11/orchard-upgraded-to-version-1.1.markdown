The [Orchard CMS](http://www.orchardproject.net "Orchard Project") project is now at version 1.1\. There are upgrade [instructions](http://orchardproject.net/docs/Upgrading-a-site-to-a-new-version-of-Orchard.ashx "Instructions") at the Orchard documentation site. Future versions of Orchard will be able to take advantage of the new import/export feature that was added to 1.1.

I am currently using version 1.0 for this site, but I plan on upgrading to version 1.1 soon.
