From Ovi at JaxMUG;

### Dec 4th, Last meeting for 2012 - Introduction to MonoTouch by Irv Adams

We will develop a single-screen iPhone app from scratch that does tip (gratuity) calculations. This is an app I wrote and published in the Apple App store. I will show the code that comprises the business logic, which is C# but is compiled on a Mac using MonoTouch. This process converts it to Objective-C. I will also demonstrate Apple's Xcode and Interface Builder and how they interact with MonoTouch. I will talk about some of the steps necessary to get your apps into the app store.
