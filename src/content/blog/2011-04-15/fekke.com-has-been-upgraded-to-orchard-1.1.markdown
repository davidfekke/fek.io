I just made the upgrade to from [Orchard](http://orchardproject.net/ "Orchard Project") version 1.0 to Orchard 1.1 for the Fekke.com site. The upgrade was relatively easy following the instructions in the [orchard documentation](http://orchardproject.net/docs/Upgrading-a-site-to-a-new-version-of-Orchard.ashx "Orchard Upgrade").

Orchard 1.1 was demoed at the MIX11 keynote this week. You can watch a video of the new features and modules at the following [link](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX11/KEY01 "MIX11 Keynote").
