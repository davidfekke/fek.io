I am going to be doing the presentation this month at the [JaxArcSig](http://www.meetup.com/JaxArcSIG/events/100991602/ "JaxArcSig"). The topic will be on [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript"), which is a language based on Javascript. TypeScript essentially adds a type system to Javascript. It also allows developers create classes and modules in Javascript.

The language is being developed at Microsoft. Anders Hejlsberg is the primary designer. They have added a project type in Visual Studio 2012 where you can write TypeScript, and VS will compile TypeScript down into Javascript. You can also use the Node Package Manager in Node JS to download the compiler. The compiler is written in TypeScript.

The meeting will start at 6:00 PM at Building 500 at the Bank of America campus on February 26th. Here is a map to the location.
