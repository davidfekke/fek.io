I will be giving my [presentation](http://jaxcodecamp.com/Agenda.aspx/Sessions "Sessions") on ASP.NET MVC 3 and 4 at this Saturday's [Jacksonville Code Camp](http://www.jaxcodecamp.com "Jax Code Camp"). My presentation will cover the MVC framework, code first databases and scaffolding. MVC is getting much broader adoption in the enterprise, and it is certainly worth learning more about this framework.

The MVC team is working on version 4 of the framework that will be coming out at the beginning of next year. Part of my presentation will be on some of the new features that are coming out in this version. Some of these features include better mobile support and the web api.

I look forward to seeing you there on Saturday.
